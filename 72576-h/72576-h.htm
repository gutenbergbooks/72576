<p class="dropcap">Ethel calls the woman some
opprobrious epithet, but walks
away nevertheless, and lets her
do as she will; only the next day
she writes a full account to Charlie of what
she has gone through, and tells him she
thinks all the servants are going mad. In
which opinion he entirely agrees with her.</p>

<p>‘For “mad” read “bad,”’ he writes
back again, ‘and I’m with you. There
is no doubt upon the matter, my dear
girl. The brutes don’t like the cold, and
are playing tricks upon you to try and
force you to return to the plains. It is
a common thing in this country. Don’t
give way to them, but tell them I’ll stop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
their pay all round if anything unpleasant
happens again. I think now you must
confess it would have been better to take
my advice and try a trip home instead.
However, as you are at Mandalinati, don’t
come back until your object in going there
is accomplished. I wish I could join you,
but it is impossible just yet. Jack Lawless
is obliged to go north on business, and I
have promised to accompany him. Keep
up a good heart, dearest, and don’t let
those brutes think they have any power
to annoy or frighten you.’</p>

<p>‘Going north on business!’ exclaims
Ethel bitterly; ‘and she is going too, I
suppose; and Charlie can find time to go
with them, though he cannot come to me.
Oh, it is too hard! It is more than any
woman can be expected to bear! I’m sure
I wish I had gone to England instead.
Then I should at least have had my dear
sister to tell my troubles to, and he—he
would have been free to flirt with that
wretched woman as much as ever he
chose.’</p>

<p>And the poor wife lies in her bed that
night too unhappy to sleep, while she
pictures her husband doing all sorts of
dishonourable things, instead of snoring,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
as he really is, in his own deserted couch.
Her room adjoins that in which the Dye
is sleeping with her little girl, and the
door between them stands wide open.
From where she lies, Ethel can see part
of the floor of Katie’s bedroom, from
which the moonlight is excluded in consequence
of the great black shawl which
the nurse continues to pin nightly across
the window-pane. Suddenly, as she watches
the shaded floor without thinking of it, a
streak of moonshine darts right athwart
it, as if a corner of the curtain had been
raised. Always full of fears for her child,
Ethel slips off her own bed, and with
noiseless, unslippered feet runs into the
next room, only in time to see part of a
white dress upon the terrace as some unseen
hand hastily drops the shawl again.
She crosses the floor, and opening the
window, looks out. Nobody is in sight.
From end to end of the broad terraces
the moonlight lies undisturbed by any
shadow, though she fancies her ear can
discern the rustling of a garment sweeping
the stone foundation. As she turns to the
darkened chamber again, she finds the Dye
is sitting up, awake and trembling.</p>

<p>‘Who raised that shawl just now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Dye? Tell me—I will know!’ says Mrs
Dunstan.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mam! How can poor Dye tell?
Perhaps it was the English lady come to
take my little missy! Oh! when shall we
go back to Mudlianah and be safe again?’</p>

<p>‘English fiddlesticks! Don’t talk such
rubbish to me. I am up to all your
tricks, but you won’t frighten me, and so
you may tell the others. And I shall not
go back to Mudlianah one day sooner for
anything you may say or do—’</p>

<p>Yet Mrs Ethel does not feel quite comfortable,
even though her words are so
brave. But shortly afterwards her thoughts
are turned into another direction, whether
agreeably or otherwise, we shall see. As
she is sitting at breakfast the next morning,
a shouting of natives and a commotion in
the courtyard warns her of a new arrival.
She imagines it is her husband, and rushes
to meet him. But, to her surprise and
chagrin, the figure that emerges from the
transit is that of Mrs Lawless looking as
lovely in her travelling dress and rumpled
hair as ever she did in the most extravagant
<i>costume de bal</i>.</p>

<p>‘Are you surprised to see me?’ she
cried, as she jumps to the ground. ‘Well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
my dear, you can hardly be more surprised
than I am to find myself here. But the
fact is, Jack and the colonel are off to
Hoolabad on business, so I thought I
would take advantage of their absence to
pay you a visit. And I hope you are glad
to see me?’</p>

<p>Of course Mrs Dunstan says she <i>is</i> glad,
and in a measure her words are true. She
is glad to keep this fascinating wicked
flirt under her eye, where it is impossible
she can tamper with the affections of her
beloved Charlie, and she is glad of her
company and conversation, which is as
sociable and bright as a clever little woman
can make it. Mrs Lawless is full of
sympathy, too, with Mrs Dunstan’s fears
and the bad behaviour of her servants, and
being a very good linguist, she promises
to obtain all the information she can from
them, and make them fully understand
their mistress’s intentions in return.</p>

<p>‘It’s lucky I came, my dear,’ she says
brightly, ‘or they might have made themselves
still more offensive to you. But you
have the dear colonel and Jack to thank
for that, for I shouldn’t have left home if
they had not done so.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, just as I imagined,’ thinks Ethel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
‘she would not have left him unless she
had been obliged, and she has the impudence
to tell me so to my very face.
However, she is here, and I must
make the best of it, and be thankful
it has happened so.’ And so she lays
herself out to please her guest in order
to keep her by her as long as she possibly
can.</p>

<p>But a few days after Cissy’s arrival she
receives a letter that evidently discomposes
her. She keeps on exclaiming,
‘How provoking!’ and ‘How annoying!’
as she peruses it, and folds it up with an
unmistakable frown on her brow.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ demands Ethel.
‘I hope it is not bad news.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is very bad news. They have
never gone after all, Mrs Dunstan, and
Jack is so vexed I should have left Mudlianah
before he started.’</p>

<p>‘But now you are here, you will not
think of returning directly, I hope,’ says
Ethel, in an anxious voice.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, I suppose not—it would be so
childish—that is, unless Jack wishes me to
do so. But I have hardly recovered from
the effects of the journey yet; those transits
shake so abominably. No, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
certainly stay here for a few weeks, unless
my husband orders me to return.’</p>

<p>Yet Mrs Lawless appears undecided
and restless from that moment, which
Mrs Dunstan ascribes entirely to her wish
to return to Mudlianah, and her flirtation
with the colonel, and the suspicion makes
her receive any allusions to such a contingency
with marked coolness. Cissy
Lawless busies herself going amongst the
natives, and talking with them about the
late disturbances at the castle, and her
report is not satisfactory.</p>

<p>‘Are you easily frightened, Mrs Dunstan?’
she asks her one day suddenly.</p>

<p>‘No, I think not. Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because you must think me a fool if
you like, but I am; and the stories your
servants have told me have made me quite
nervous of remaining at the castle.’</p>

<p>‘A good excuse to leave me and go back
to Mudlianah,’ thinks Mrs Dunstan; and
then she draws herself up stiffly, and says,
‘Indeed! You must be very credulous if
you believe what natives say. What may
these dreadful stories consist of?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I daresay you will turn them into
ridicule, because, perhaps, you don’t believe
in ghosts.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>‘Ghosts! I should think not, indeed.
Who does?’</p>

<p>‘I do, Mrs Dunstan, and for the good
reason that I have seen more than one.’</p>

<p>‘You have seen a spirit? What will
you tell me next?’</p>

<p>‘That I hope you never may, for it is
not a pleasant sight. But that has nothing
to do with the present rumours. I find
that your servants are really frightened of
remaining at the castle. They say there
is not a native in the villages round about
who would enter it for love or money, and
that the reason the Rajah Mati Singh has
deserted it is on account of its reputation
for being haunted.’</p>

<p>‘Every one has heard of that,’ replies
Ethel, with a heightened colour, ‘but no
one believes it. Who should it be haunted
by?’</p>

<p>‘You know what a bad character the
rajah bears for cruelty and oppression.
They say he built this castle for a harem,
and kidnapped a beautiful English woman,
a soldier’s daughter, and confined her here
for some years. But, finding one day that
she had been attempting to communicate
with her own people, he had her most barbarously
put to death, with her child and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the servants he suspected of conniving with
her. Then he established a native harem
here, but was obliged to remove it, for no
infant born in the house ever lived. They
say that as soon as a child is born under
this roof, the spirit of the white woman
appears to carry it away in place of her
own. But the natives declare that she is
not satisfied with the souls of black children,
and that she will continue to appear
until she has secured a white child like the
one that was murdered before her eyes.
And your servants assure me that she has
been seen by several of them since coming
here, and they feel certain that she is waiting
for your baby to be born that she may
carry it away.’</p>

<p>‘What folly!’ cries Mrs Dunstan, whose
cheeks have nevertheless grown very red.
‘It’s all a <i>ruse</i> in order to make me go
home again. In the first place, I should
be ashamed to believe in such nonsense,
and in the second, I do not expect my
baby to be born until I am back in
Mudlianah.’</p>

<p>‘But accidents happen some times, you
know, dear Mrs Dunstan, and it would be
a terrible thing if you were taken ill up
here. Don’t you think, all things considered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
it would be more prudent for you
to go home again?’</p>

<p>‘No, I do not,’ replied Mrs Dunstan,
decidedly. ‘I came here for my child’s
health, and I shall stay until it is re-established.’</p>

<p>‘But you must feel so lonely by yourself.’</p>

<p>‘I have plenty to do and to think of,’
says Ethel, ‘and I never want company
whilst I am with my little Katie.’</p>

<p>She is determined to take neither pity
nor advice from the woman who is so
anxious to join the colonel again.</p>

<p>‘I am glad to hear you say so,’ replied
Mrs Lawless, somewhat timidly, ‘because
it makes it easier for me to tell you that
I am afraid I must leave you. I daresay
you will think me very foolish, but
I am too nervous to remain any longer
at Mandalinati. I have not slept a wink
for the last three nights. I must go back
to Jack.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! you must go back to Jack!’
repeats Mrs Dunstan, with a sneer at Mrs
Lawless. ‘I hate duplicity! Why can’t
you tell the truth at once?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Dunstan! What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I mean that I know why you are going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
back to Mudlianah as well as you do yourself.
It’s all very well to lay it upon “Jack,”
or this ridiculous ghost; but you don’t
deceive me. I have known your treachery
for a long time past. It is not “Jack” you
go back to cantonment for—but my husband,
and you are a bad, wicked woman.’</p>

<p>‘For your husband!’ cried Cissy Lawless,
jumping to her feet. ‘How dare you
insult me in this manner! What have
I ever done to make you credit such an
absurdity?’</p>

<p>‘You may call it an absurdity, madam,
if you choose, but I call it a diabolical
wickedness. Haven’t you made appointments
with him, and walked at night in the
garden with him, and done all you could
to make him faithless to his poor, trusting
wife? And you a married woman, too.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Dunstan, I will not stand this
language any longer. I flirt with your
husband!—a man old enough to be my
father! You must be out of your senses!
Why, he must be fifty if he’s a day!’</p>

<p>‘He’s not fifty,’ screams Ethel, in her
rage. ‘He was only forty-two last birthday.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe it. His hair is as grey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
as a badger. Flirt with the colonel, indeed.
When I want to flirt I shall look for a
younger and a handsomer man than your
husband, I can tell you.’</p>

<p>‘You’d flirt with him if he were eighty,
you bold, forward girl, and I shall take
good care to inform Mr Lawless of the
way you have been carrying on with him.’</p>

<p>‘I shall go down at once, and tell him
myself. You don’t suppose I would remain
your guest after what has happened
for an hour longer than is absolutely
necessary. I wish you good morning,
Mrs Dunstan, and a civil tongue for the
future.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, of course, you’ll go to Mudlianah.
I was quite prepared for that, and an excellent
excuse you have found to get back
again. Good day, madam, and the less
we meet before you start the better.
Grey haired, indeed! Why, many men
are grey at thirty, and I’ve often been
told that he used to be called “Handsome
Charlie” when he first joined the service.’</p>

<p>But the wife’s indignant protests do
not reach the ears of Cissy Lawless, who
retires to her own apartments and does
not leave them until she gets into the
transit again and is rattled back to Mudlianah.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
When she is fairly off there is no
denying that Ethel feels very lonely and
very miserable. She is not so brave as
she pretends to be, and she is conscious
that she has betrayed her jealous feelings
in a most unladylike manner, which will
make Charlie very angry with her when
he comes to hear of it. So what between
her rage and her despair, she passes the
afternoon and evening in a very hysterical
condition of weeping and moaning, and
the excitement and fatigue, added to
terror at the stories she has heard, bring
on the very calamity against which Mrs
Lawless warned her. In the middle of
the night she is compelled by illness to
summon her Dye to her assistance, and two
frightened women do their best to alarm
each other still more, until with the morning’s
light a poor little baby is born into
the world, who had no business, strictly
speaking, to have entered it till two months
later, and the preparations for whose
advent are all down at Mudlianah. Poor
Ethel has only strength after the event to
write a few faint lines in pencil to Colonel
Dunstan, telling him she is dying, and
begging him to come to her at once, and
then to lie down in a state of utter despair,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
which would assail most women under the
circumstances. She has not sufficient
energy even to reprove the Dye, who
laments over the poor baby as if it were a
doomed creature, and keeps starting nervously,
as night draws on again, at every
shadow, as though she expected to see the
old gentleman at her elbow.</p>

<p>She wears out Ethel’s patience at last,
for the young mother is depressed and
feeble and longs for sleep. So she orders
the nurse to lay her little infant on her
arm, and to go into the next room as usual
and lie down beside Katie’s cot; and after
some expostulation, and many shakings
of her head, the Dye complies with her
mistress’s request. For some time after
she is left alone, Ethel lies awake, too
exhausted even to sleep, and as she does
so, her mind is filled with the stories she
has heard, and she clasps her little fragile
infant closer to her bosom as she recalls
the history of the poor murdered mother,
whose child was barbarously slaughtered
before her eyes. But she has too much
faith in the teaching of her childhood quite
to credit such a marvellous story, and she
composes herself by prayer and holy
thoughts until she sinks into a calm and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
dreamless slumber. When she wakes
some hours after, it is not suddenly, but
as though some one were pulling her back
to consciousness. Slowly she realises her
situation, and feels that somebody, the
Dye she supposes, is trying to take the
baby from her arms without disturbing
her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t take him from me, Dye,’ she
murmurs, sleepily; ‘he is so good—he has
not moved all night.’</p>

<p>But the gentle pressure still continues,
and then Ethel opens her eyes and sees
not the Dye but a woman, tall and finely
formed, and fair as the day, with golden
hair floating over her shoulders, and a wild,
mad look in her large blue eyes, who is
quietly but forcibly taking the baby from
her. Already she has one bare arm under
the child, and the other over him—and her
figure is bent forward, so that her beautiful
face is almost on a level with that of Mrs
Dunstan’s.</p>

<p>‘Who are you? What are you doing?’
exclaims Ethel in a voice of breathless
alarm, although she does not at once comprehend
why she should experience it.
The woman makes no answer, but
with her eyes fixed on the child with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
a sort of wild triumph draws it steadily
towards her.</p>

<p>‘Leave my baby alone! How dare
you touch him?’ cries Ethel, and then
she calls aloud, ‘Dye! Dye! come to
me!’</p>

<p>But at the sound of her voice the
woman draws the child hastily away,
and Ethel sees it reposing on her arm,
whilst she slowly folds her white robes
about the little form, and hides it from
view.</p>

<p>‘Dye! Dye!’ again screams the mother,
and as the nurse rushes to her assistance
the spirit woman slowly fades away, with
a smile of success upon her lips.</p>

<p>‘Bring a light. Quick!’ cries Ethel.
‘The woman has been here; she has
stolen my baby. Oh, Dye, make haste!
help me to get out of bed. I will get it
back again if I die in the attempt.’</p>

<p>The Dye runs for a lamp, and brings it
to the bedside as Mrs Dunstan is attempting
to leave it.</p>

<p>‘Missus dreaming!’ she exclaims quickly,
as the light falls on the pillow. ‘The baby
is there—safe asleep. Missus get into bed
again, and cover up well, or she will catch
cold!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah! my baby,’ cries Ethel, hysterically,
as she seizes the tiny creature in her arms,
‘is he really there? Thank God! It was
only a dream. But, Dye, what is the
matter with him, and why is he so stiff
and cold? He cannot—he cannot be—dead!’</p>

<p>Yes, it was true! It was not a dream
after all. The white woman has carried
the soul of the white child away with her,
and left nothing but the senseless little
body behind. As Ethel realises the extent
of her misfortune, and the means by which
it has been perpetrated, she sinks back
upon her pillow in a state of utter unconsciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When she once more becomes aware of all
that is passing around her, she finds her
husband by her bedside, and Cissy Lawless
acting the part of the most devoted of
nurses.</p>

<p>‘It was so wrong of me to leave you,
dear, in that hurried manner,’ she whispers
one day when Mrs Dunstan is convalescent,
‘but I was so angry to think you
could suspect me of flirting with your dear
old husband. I ought to have told you
from the first what all those meetings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
letters meant, and I should have done so
only they involved the character of my
darling Jack. The fact is, dear, my boy
got into a terrible scrape up country—and
the colonel says the less we talk of it the
better—however, it had something to do
with that horrid gambling that men will
indulge in, and it very nearly lost Jack his
commission, and would have done so if it
hadn’t been for the dear colonel. But he
and I plotted and worked together till we
got Jack out of his scrape, and now we’re
as happy as two kings; and you will be so
too, won’t you dear Mrs Dunstan, now
that you are well again, and know that
your Charlie has flirted no more than
yourself?’</p>

<p>‘I have been terribly to blame,’ replies
poor Ethel. ‘I see that now, and I have
suffered for it too, bitterly.’</p>

<p>‘We have all suffered, my darling,’ says
the colonel, tenderly; ‘but it may teach
us a valuable lesson, never to believe that
which we have not proved.’</p>

<p>‘And never to disbelieve that which we
have not disproved,’ retorts Ethel. ‘If I
had only been a little more credulous and
a little less boastful of my own courage, I
might not have lived to see my child torn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
from my arms by the spirit of the white
woman.’</p>

<p>And whatever Ethel Dunstan believed
or not, I have only, in concluding her story,
to reiterate my assertion that the circumstances
of it are <i>strictly true</i>.</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

Bible tells us, ‘the secrets of all
hearts shall be revealed,’ they
will be revealed to our fellow-creatures
as well as to the Almighty Judge
of men.</p>

<p>I am not usually given to philosophise,
but the above remark was drawn from me
by the receipt of a letter this morning from
my niece, Justina Trevor, announcing the
death of her ‘dear friend,’ Mrs Benson,
which recalled the remembrance of an incident
that took place a few months since,
whilst I was staying at Durham Hall, in
Derbyshire, the estate of her late husband,
Sir Harry Trevor. I am an old bachelor,
though not so old as I look; yet when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
confess that I write ‘General’ before my
name, and have served most of my time
in hot climates, it will readily be believed
that no one would take me for a chicken.
It was after an absence of fourteen years
that, last November, I arrived in England,
and put up at an hotel near Covent Garden,
which had been a favourite resort of
mine during my last stay in London. But
I soon found that I had made a great
mistake, for town was dark, damp, dirty,
deserted, detestable; in fact, no adjective,
however long and however strong, could
convey an adequate idea of the impression
made upon me by a review of the great
metropolis; and it was with a feeling of
intense relief that I perused a letter from
my niece Justina, to whom I had duly
announced my advent, in which she insisted
that her ‘dear uncle’ must spend
his first Christmas in England nowhere
but at Durham Hall, with Sir Harry and
herself. Now Justina, if not my only, is
certainly my nearest relative, and <i>I</i> knew
that <i>she</i> knew that I was an old fellow on
the shady side of sixty-five, with a couple
of pounds or so laid by in the Oriental
Bank, and with no one to leave them to
but herself or her children; but I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
not going to let that fact interfere with
my prospects of present comfort; and so,
ordering my servant to repack my travelling
cases, the next day but one saw us
<i>en route</i> for Derbyshire.</p>

<p>It was evening when I arrived at Durham
Hall, but even on a first view I could
not help being struck with the munificent
manner in which all the arrangements of
the household seemed to be conducted,
and reflected with shame on the unworthy
suspicion I had entertained respecting
those two pounds of mine in the
Oriental Bank, which I now felt would be
but as a drop in the ocean to the display
of wealth which surrounded me. The
hall was full of guests, assembled to enjoy
the hunting and shooting season, and to
spend the coming Christmas, and amongst
them I heard several persons of title mentioned;
but my host and hostess paid as
much attention to me as though I had
been the noblest there, and I felt gratified
by the reception awarded me.</p>

<p>I found my niece but little altered, considering
the number of years which had
elapsed since I had last seen her; her
children were a fine, blooming set of boys
and girls, whilst her husband, both in appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and manners, far exceeded my
expectations. For it so happened that I
had not seen Sir Harry Trevor before, my
niece’s marriage having taken place during
my absence from England; but Justina
had never ceased to correspond with me,
and from her letters I knew that the union
had been as happy as it was prosperous.
But now that I met him I was more than
pleased, and voted his wife a most fortunate
woman. Of unusual height and muscular
build, Sir Harry Trevor possessed
one of those fair, frank Saxon faces which
look as if their owners had never known
trouble. His bright blue eyes shone with
careless mirth and his yellow beard curled
about a mouth ever ready to smile in unison
with the outstretching of his friendly hand.</p>

<p>He was a specimen of a free, manly, and
contented Englishman, who had everything
he could desire in this world, and was
thankful for it. As for Justina, she seemed
perfectly to adore him; her eyes followed
his figure wherever it moved; she hung
upon his words, and refused to stir from
home, even to take a drive or walk, unless
he were by her side.</p>

<p>‘I must congratulate you upon your
husband,’ I said to her, as we sat together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
on the second day of my visit. ‘I think
he is one of the finest fellows I ever came
across, and seems as good as he is handsome.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, he is, indeed!’ she replied, with
ready enthusiasm; ‘and you have seen the
least part of him, uncle. It would be impossible
for me to tell you how good he is
in all things. We have been married now
for more than ten years, and during that
time I have never had an unkind word
from him, nor do I believe he has ever
kept a thought from me. He is as open
as the day, and could not keep a secret if
he tried. Dear fellow!’ and something
very like a tear twinkled in the wife’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay,’ I replied, ‘that’s right. I
don’t know much about matrimony, my
dear, but if man and wife never have a
secret from one another they can’t go far
wrong. And now perhaps you will enlighten
me a little about these guests of
yours, for there is such a number of them
that I feel quite confused.’</p>

<p>Justina passed her hand across her eyes
and laughed.</p>

<p>‘Yes, that is dear Harry’s whim. He will
fill the house at Christmas from top to basement,
and I let him have his way, though all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
my visitors are not of my own choosing.
With whom shall I commence, uncle?’</p>

<p>We were sitting on a sofa together during
the half-hour before dinner, and one
by one the guests, amounting perhaps to
fifteen or twenty, came lounging into the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘Who, then, is that very handsome woman
with the scarlet flower in her hair?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, do you call <i>her</i> handsome?’ (I
could tell at once from the tone of Justina’s
voice that the owner of the scarlet flower
was no favourite of hers.) ‘That is Lady
Amabel Scott, a cousin of Harry’s: indeed,
if she were not, she should never come
into <i>my</i> house. Now, there’s a woman,
uncle, whom I can’t bear—a forward, presuming,
flirting creature, with no desire on
earth but to attract admiration. Look
how she’s dressed this evening—absurd,
for a home party. I wonder that her husband,
Mr Warden Scott (that is he looking
over the photograph book), can allow her
to go on so! It is quite disgraceful. I
consider a flirting married woman one of
the most dangerous members of society.’</p>

<p>‘But you can have no reason to fear her
attacks,’ I said, confidently.</p>

<p>The colour mounted to her face. My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
niece is not a pretty woman—indeed, I had
already wondered several times what made
Trevor fall in love with her—but this little
touch of indignation improved her.</p>

<p>‘<i>Of course not!</i> But Lady Amabel spares
no one, and dear Harry is so good-natured
that he refuses to see how conspicuous she
makes both him and herself. I have tried
to convince him of it several times, but he
is too kind to think evil of any one, and so
I must be as patient as I can till she goes.
Thank Heaven, she does not spend her
Christmas with us! For my part, I can’t
understand how one can see any beauty in
a woman with a turned-up nose.’</p>

<p>‘Ho, ho!’ I thought to myself; ‘this is
where the shoe pinches, is it? And if a
lady will secure an uncommonly good-looking
and agreeable man all to herself,
she must expect to see others attempt to
share the prize with her.’</p>

<p>Poor Justina! With as many blessings
as one would think heart could desire, she
was not above poisoning her life’s happiness
by a touch of jealousy; and so I pitied
her. It is a terrible foe with which to
contend.</p>

<p>‘But this is but one off the list,’ I continued,
wishing to divert her mind from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the contemplation of Sir Harry’s cousin.
‘Who are those two dark girls standing
together at the side table? and who is
that quiet-looking little lady who has just
entered with the tall man in spectacles?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, those—the girls—are the Misses
Rushton; they are pretty, are they not?—were
considered quite the belles of last
season—and the old lady on the opposite
side of the fireplace is their mother: their
father died some years since.’</p>

<p>‘But the gentleman in spectacles? He
looks quite a character.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and is considered so, but he is
very good and awfully clever. That is
Professor Benson: you must know him
and his wife too, the “quiet-looking little
lady,” as you called her just now. They
are the greatest friends I have in the
world, and it was at their house that I first
met Harry. I am sure you would like
Mary Benson, uncle; she is shy, but has
an immense deal in her, and is the kindest
creature I ever knew. You would get on
capitally together. I must introduce you
to each other after dinner. And the professor
and she are so attached—quite a
model couple, I can assure you.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! But whom have we here?’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
as the door was thrown open to admit five
gentlemen and two ladies.</p>

<p>‘Lord and Lady Mowbray; Colonel
Green and his son and daughter; Captain
Mackay and Mr Cecil St John,’ whispered
Lady Trevor, and as she concluded dinner
was announced, and our dialogue ended.</p>

<p>As the only persons in whom my niece
had expressed much interest were Lady
Amabel Scott and Mrs Benson, I took
care to observe these two ladies very narrowly
during my leisure moments at the
dinner-table, and came to the conclusion
that, so far as I could judge, her estimate
was not far wrong of either of them. Lady
Amabel was a decided beauty, notwithstanding
the ‘turned-up nose’ of which
her hostess had spoken so contemptuously;
it was also pretty evident that she
was a decided flirt. During my lengthened
career of five-and-sixty years, I had always
been credited with having a keen eye for
the good points of a woman or a horse;
but seldom had I met with such vivid
colouring, such flashing eyes, and such
bright speaking looks as now shone upon
me across the table from the cousin of Sir
Harry Trevor. She was a lovely blonde,
in the heyday of her youth and beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and she used her power unsparingly and
without reserve. My observation quickened
by what Justina’s flash of jealousy
had revealed, I now perceived, or thought
I perceived, that our host was by no means
insensible to the attractions of his fair
guest, for, after conducting her in to dinner
and placing her by his side, he devoted
every second not demanded by the rights
of hospitality to her amusement. Yet,
Lady Amabel seemed anything but desirous
of engrossing his attention; on the
contrary, her arrows of wit flew far and
wide, and her bright glances flashed much
in the same manner, some of their beams
descending even upon me, spite of my
grey hairs and lack of acquaintanceship.
One could easily perceive that she was a
universal favourite; but as Mr Warden
Scott seemed quite satisfied with the state
of affairs, and calmly enjoyed his dinner,
whilst his wife’s admirers, in their fervent
admiration, neglected to eat theirs, I could
not see that any one had a right to complain,
and came to the conclusion that my
niece, like many another of her sex, had
permitted jealousy to blind her judgment.</p>

<p>I felt still more convinced of this when
I turned to the contemplation of the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
lady to whom she had directed my attention—the
professor’s wife, who was her
dearest friend, and through whose means
she had first met Sir Harry Trevor. There
was certainly nothing to excite the evil
passions of either man or woman in Mrs
Benson. Small and insignificant in figure,
she was not even pleasing in countenance;
indeed, I voted her altogether uninteresting,
until she suddenly raised two large
brown eyes, soft as a spaniel’s and shy as
a deer’s, and regarded me. She dropped
them again instantly, but as she did so I
observed that her lashes were long and
dark, and looked the longer and darker
for resting on perfectly pallid cheeks. <i>Au
reste</i>, Mrs Benson had not a feature that
would repay the trouble of looking at
twice, and the plain, dark dress she wore
still farther detracted from her appearance.
But she looked a good, quiet, harmless
little thing, who, if she really possessed
the sense Lady Trevor attributed to her,
might prove a very valuable and worthy
friend. But she was certainly not the
style of woman to cause any one a heartache,
or to make a wife rue the day she
met her.</p>

<p>And indeed, when, dinner being over,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
we joined the ladies in the drawing-room,
and I saw her surrounded by my grand-nephews
and nieces, who seemed by one
accord to have singled her out for persecution,
I thought she looked much more
like a governess or some one in a dependent
situation than the most welcome guest
at Durham Hall. Sir Harry seemed
pleased with her notice of his children, for
he took a seat by her side and entered into
conversation with her, the first time that I
had seen him pay his wife’s friend so open
a compliment. Now I watched eagerly
for the ‘great deal’ that by Justina’s account
was ‘in her;’ but I was disappointed,
for she seemed disinclined for a <i>tête-à-tête</i>,
and after a few futile attempts to draw her
out, I was not surprised to see her host
quit his position and wander after Lady
Amabel Scott into the back drawing-room,
whither my niece’s eyes followed him in a
restless and uneasy manner.</p>

<p>‘I promised to introduce you to Mrs
Benson, uncle,’ she exclaimed, as she perceived
that I was watching her, and willy-nilly,
I was taken forcible possession of,
and soon found myself occupying the chair
left vacant by Sir Harry.</p>

<p>‘We can so very seldom persuade Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
to stay with us; and when she does come,
her visits are so brief that we are obliged
to make a great deal of them whilst they
last,’ was part of Justina’s introduction
speech; and on that hint I commenced to
speak of the charms of the country and my
wonder that Mrs Benson did not oftener
take occasion to enjoy them. But barely
an answer, far less an idea, could I extract
from my niece’s valued friend. Mrs Benson’s
brown eyes were not once raised to
meet mine, and the replies which I forced
from her lips came in monosyllables. I
tried another theme, but with no better
success; and had just decided that she
was as stupid as she looked, when, to my
great relief, the professor arrived with a
message from Lady Trevor, and bore his
wife off into another room.</p>

<p>Several days passed without bringing
forth much incident. The gentlemen
spent most of their time in the shooting-covers
or hunting-field, and did not meet
the ladies until evening re-assembled them
in the drawing-room; on which occasions
I used to get as far as I could from Lady
Trevor and the professor’s wife, and in
consequence generally found myself in the
vicinity of Sir Harry and Lady Amabel.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
Yet, free and intimate as seemed their
intercourse with one another, and narrowly
as, in Justina’s interest, I watched them, I
could perceive nothing in their conduct
which was not justified by their relationship,
and treated it as a matter of the
smallest consequence, until one afternoon
about a fortnight after my arrival at Durham
Hall.</p>

<p>With the exception of Sir Harry himself,
who had business to transact with his
bailiff, we had all been out shooting, and
as, after a hard day’s work, I was toiling
up to my bedroom to dress for dinner,
I had occasion to pass the study appropriated
to the master of the house, and
with a sudden desire to give him an account
of our sport, incontinently turned
the handle of the door. As I did so I
heard an exclamation and the rustle of a
woman’s dress, which were sufficient to
make me halt upon the threshold of the
half-opened door, and ask if I might enter.</p>

<p>‘Come in, by all means,’ exclaimed Sir
Harry. He was lying back indolently in
his arm-chair beside a table strewn with
books and papers,—a little flushed, perhaps,
but otherwise himself, and, to my
astonishment, quite alone. Yet I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
positive that I had heard the unmistakable
sound of a woman’s dress sweeping the
carpet. Involuntarily I glanced around
the room; but there was no egress.</p>

<p>Sir Harry caught my look of inquiry,
and seemed annoyed. ‘What are you
staring at, Wilmer?’ he demanded, in the
curtest tone I had yet heard from him.</p>

<p>‘May I not glance round your den?’ I
replied courteously. ‘I have not had the
honour of seeing it before.’</p>

<p>Then I entered into a few details with
him concerning the day’s sport we had
enjoyed; but I took care to be brief, for I
saw that my presence there displeased
him, and I could not get the rustle of that
dress out of my mind. As I concluded,
and with some remark upon the lateness
of the hour, turned to leave the room, a
cough sounded from behind a large Indian
screen which stood in one corner. It was
the faintest, most subdued of coughs, but
sufficiently tangible to be sworn to; and
as it fell upon my ear I could not help a
change of countenance.</p>

<p>‘All right!’ said my host, with affected
nonchalance, as he rose and almost backed
me to the door. ‘We’ll have a talk over
all this after dinner, Wilmer; sorry I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
wasn’t with you; but, as you say, it’s late.
<i>Au revoir!</i>’ and simultaneously the study
door closed upon me.</p>

<p>I was very much startled and very much
shocked. I had not a doubt that I was
correct in my surmise that Sir Harry had
some visitor in his room whom he had
thought it necessary to conceal from me;
and though Hope suggested that it might
have been his wife, Common Sense rose
up to refute so absurd an idea. Added to
which, I had not traversed twenty yards
after leaving him before I met Justina
attired in her walking things, and just
returning from a stroll round the garden.</p>

<p>‘Is it very late, uncle?’ she demanded,
with a smile, as we encountered one another.
‘I have been out with the children.
Have you seen Mary or Lady Amabel?
I am afraid they will think I have neglected
them shamefully this afternoon.’</p>

<p>I answered her questions indifferently,
thinking the while that she had no occasion
to blame herself for not having paid
sufficient attention to Lady Amabel Scott,
for that it was she whom I had surprised
<i>tête-à-tête</i> with Sir Harry Trevor, I had
not a shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>Well, I was not the one to judge them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
nor to bring them to judgment; but I
thought very hard things of Sir Harry’s
cousin during the dressing hour, and pitied
my poor niece, who must some day inevitably
learn that it was a true instinct which
had made her shrink from her beautiful
guest. And during the evening which
followed my discovery, I turned with disgust
from the lightning glances which
darted from Lady Amabel’s blue eyes, and
the arch smile which helped to make them
so seductive. I could no longer think her
beauty harmless: the red curves of her
mouth were cruel serpents in my mind;
poisoned arrows flew from her lips; there
was no innocence left in look, or word, or
action; and I found myself turning with
a sensation of relief to gaze at the Quaker-like
attire, the downcast eyes, and modest
appearance of the professor’s wife, whilst
I inwardly blamed myself for having ever
been so foolish as to be gulled into believing
that the flaunting beauty of Lady
Amabel Scott was superior to Mrs Benson’s
quiet graces.</p>

<p>I did not have much to say to Sir Harry
Trevor during that evening: indignation
for his deception towards Justina made me
disinclined to speak to him, whilst he, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
his part, seemed anxious to avoid me. For
a few days more all went on as usual: my
host’s affability soon returned, and every
one, my niece included, appeared so smiling
and contented, that I almost began to
think I must have been mistaken, and that
there could have been no real motive for
concealing Lady Amabel in Sir Harry’s
room, except perhaps her own girlish love
of fun. I tried to think the best I could
of both of them; and a day came but too
soon when I was thankful that I had so
tried.</p>

<p>It was about a week after the little incident
related above that Sir Harry Trevor
was shooting over his preserves, accompanied
by his guests. We had had a
capital day’s sport and an excellent luncheon—at
which latter some of the ladies
had condescended to join us—and were
beating the last cover preparatory to a
return to Durham Hall, when the report
of a firearm was quickly followed by the
news that Sir Harry Trevor had been
wounded.</p>

<p>I was separated from him by a couple of
fields when I first heard of the accident,
but it did not take me long to reach his
side, when I perceived, to my horror, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
he was fast bleeding to death, having been
shot through the lungs by the discharge of
his own gun whilst getting through the
hedge. I had seen men die from gunshot
wounds received under various circumstances,
and I felt sure that Sir Harry’s
hours were numbered; yet, of course, all
that was possible was done at once, and
five minutes had not elapsed before messengers
were flying in all directions—one
for the doctor, another for the carriage, a
third for cordials to support the sinking
man; whilst I entreated Mr Warden Scott
and several others to walk back to the
Hall as though nothing particular had
happened, and try to prevent the immediate
circulation of the full extent of the
bad news. Meanwhile, I remained by the
wounded man, who evidently suspected, by
the sinking within him, that he was dying.</p>

<p>‘Wilmer!’ he gasped, ‘old fellow, have
I settled my hash?’</p>

<p>‘I trust not, Sir Harry,’ I commenced;
but I suppose that my eyes contradicted
my words.</p>

<p>‘Don’t say any more,’ he replied, with
difficulty. ‘My head a little higher—thanks.
I feel it will soon be over.’</p>

<p>And so he lay for a few moments, supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
on my knee, with his fast glazing
eyes turned upward to the December sky,
and his breath coming in short, quick
jerks.</p>

<p>The men who had remained with me
seemed as though they could not endure
the sight of his sufferings; one or two
gazed at him speechless and almost as pale
as himself; but the majority had turned
away to hide their feelings.</p>

<p>‘Wilmer,’ he whispered presently, but
in a much fainter voice than before, ‘it’s
coming fast now;’ and then, to my surprise,
just as I thought he was about to
draw his last breath, he suddenly broke
into speech that was almost a sob—‘Oh,
if I could only have seen her again! I
wouldn’t mind it half so much if I could
but have seen Pet again! Call her, Wilmer;
in God’s name, call her!—call Pet
to me—only once again—only once!
Pet! Pet! Pet!’ And with that name
upon his lips, each time uttered in a
shorter and fainter voice, and with a wild
look of entreaty in his eyes, Sir Harry
Trevor let his head drop back heavily
upon my knees and died.</p>

<p>When the doctor and the carriage arrived,
the only thing left for us to do was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to convey the corpse of its master back to
Durham Hall.</p>

<p>For the first few hours I was too much
shocked by the suddenness of the blow
which had descended on us to have leisure
to think of anything else. In one moment
the house of feasting had been turned into
the house of mourning; and frightened
guests were looking into each other’s faces,
and wondering what would be the correct
thing for them to do. Of my poor niece I
saw nothing. The medical man had undertaken
to break the news of her bereavement
to her, and I confess that I was
sufficiently cowardly to shrink from encountering
the sorrow which I could do
nothing to mitigate.</p>

<p>As I passed along the silent corridors
(lately so full of mirth and revelry) that
evening, I met servants and travelling-cases
at every turn, by which I concluded,
and rightly, that the Christmas guests were
about at once to take their departure; and
on rising in the morning, I found that, with
the exception of Lady Amabel and Mr
Warden Scott, who, as relatives of the
deceased, intended to remain until after
the funeral, and the professor and Mrs
Benson, on whose delicate frame the shock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of Sir Harry’s death was said to have had
such an effect as to render her unfit for
travelling, Durham Hall was clear.</p>

<p>Lady Amabel had wept herself almost
dry: her eyes were swollen, her features
disfigured, her whole appearance changed
from the violence of her grief, and every
ten minutes she was ready to burst out
afresh.</p>

<p>We had not been together half-an-hour
on the following morning before she was
sobbing by my side, entreating me to give
her every particular of ‘poor dear Harry’s’
death, and to say if there was anything she
could do for Justina or the children; and
notwithstanding the repugnance with which
her conduct had inspired me, I could not
repulse her then. However she had
sinned, the crime and its occasion were
both past—Sir Harry was laid out ready
for his burial, and she was grieving for
him.</p>

<p>I am an old man, long past such follies
myself, and I hope I am a virtuous man;
but all my virtue could not prevent my
pitying Lady Amabel in her distress, and
affording her such comfort as was possible.
And so (a little curiosity still mingling
with my compassion) I related to her in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
detail, whilst I narrowly watched her
features, the last words which had been
spoken by her cousin. But if she guessed
for whom that dying entreaty had been
urged, she did not betray herself.</p>

<p>‘Poor fellow!’ was her only remark as
she wiped her streaming eyes—‘poor dear
Harry! Used he to call Justina “Pet?”
I never heard him do so.’</p>

<p>Whereupon I decided that Lady Amabel
was too politic to be very miserable, and
that my pity had been wasted on her.</p>

<p>Of Mrs Benson I saw nothing, but
the professor talked about attending the
funeral, and therefore I concluded that my
niece had invited them, being such intimate
friends, to remain for that ceremony.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the same day I was
told that Justina desired to speak to me.
I sought the room where she was sitting,
with folded hands and darkened windows,
with nervous reluctance; but I need not
have dreaded a scene, for her grief was
too great for outward show, and I found
her in a state which appeared to me
unnaturally calm.</p>

<p>‘Uncle,’ she said, after a moment’s
pause, during which we had silently
shaken hands, ‘will you take these keys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and go down into—into—his study for
me, and bring up the desks and papers
which you will find in the escritoire?
I do not like to send a servant.’</p>

<p>I took the keys which she extended
to me, and, not able to trust myself to
answer, kissed her forehead and left the
room again. As I turned the handle of
the study door I shuddered, the action so
vividly recalled to me the first and last
occasion upon which I had done so. The
afternoon was now far advanced, and dusk
was approaching: the blinds of the study
windows also were pulled down, which
caused the room to appear almost in darkness.
As I groped my way toward the escritoire
I stumbled over some article lying
across my path, something which lay
extended on the hearth-rug, and which
even by that feeble light I could discern
was a prostrated body.</p>

<p>With my mind full of murderous
accidents, I rushed to the window and
drew up the blind, when to my astonishment
I found that the person over whom
I had nearly fallen was no other than
poor little Mrs Benson, who was lying
in a dead faint before the arm-chair.
Fainting women not being half so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
in my line as wounded men, I felt quite
uncertain in this case how to act, and
without considering how the professor’s
wife had come to be in the study or for
what reason, my first impulse was to ring
for assistance. But a second thought,
which came I know not how or whence,
made me lift the fragile, senseless body in
my arms and carry it outside the study
door into the passage before I called for
help, which then I did lustily, and female
servants came and bore the poor ‘quiet-looking
little lady’ away to her own apartments
and the care of her husband, leaving
me free to execute the errand upon which
I had been sent. Still, as I collected the
desk and papers required by my niece,
I could not help reflecting on the circumstance
I have related as being a strange
one, and could only account for it in my
own mind by the probable fact that Mrs
Benson had required some book from the
late Sir Harry’s shelves, and, miscalculating
her strength, had left her bedroom
with the design of fetching it, and failed
before she could accomplish her purpose.
I heard several comments made on the
occurrence, during the melancholy meal
which we now called ‘dinner,’ by her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
husband and Lady Amabel Scott, and
they both agreed with me as to the
probable reason of it; and as soon as
the cloth was removed the professor left
us to spend the evening with his wife,
who was considered sufficiently ill to require
medical attendance.</p>

<p>We were a rather silent trio in the
drawing-room—Lady Amabel, Mr Scott,
and I—for ordinary occupations seemed
forbidden, and every topic harped back to
the miserable accident which had left
the hall without a master. The servants
with lengthened faces, as though attending
a funeral, had dumbly proffered us tea
and coffee, and we had drunk them without
considering whether we required
them, so welcome seemed anything to do;
and I was seriously considering whether
it would appear discourteous in me to
leave the hall and return on the day of
the funeral, when a circumstance occurred
which proved more than sufficiently exciting
for all of us.</p>

<p>I had taken the desk, papers, and
keys, and delivered them into my niece’s
hands, and I had ventured at the same
time to ask whether it would not be a
comfort to her to see Mrs Benson or some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
other friend, instead of sitting in utter
loneliness and gloom. But Justina had
visibly shrunk from the proposal; more
than that, she had begged me not to
renew it. ‘I sent for you, uncle,’ she
said, ‘because I needed help, but don’t
let any one make it a precedent for trying
to see me. I <i>couldn’t</i> speak to any one:
it would drive me mad. Leave me alone:
my only relief is in solitude and prayer.’</p>

<p>And so I had left her, feeling that
doubtless she was right, and communicating
her wishes on the subject to Lady
Amabel Scott, who had several times
expressed a desire to gain admittance to
her widowed cousin.</p>

<p>Judge, then, of our surprise, equal and
unmitigated, when, as we sat in the
drawing-room that evening, the door
silently opened and Justina stood before
us! If she had been the ghost of Sir
Harry himself risen from the dead, she
could hardly have given us a greater
start.</p>

<p>‘Justina!’ I exclaimed, but as she advanced
toward us with her eyes riveted
on Lady Amabel, I saw that something
more than usual was the matter, and drew
backward. Justina’s countenance was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
deadly pale; her dark hair, unbound from
the night before, flowed over the white
dressing-gown which she had worn all day;
and stern and rigid she walked into the
midst of our little circle, holding a packet
of letters in her hand.</p>

<p>‘Amabel Scott,’ she hissed rather than
said as she fixed a look of perfect hatred
on the beautiful face of her dead husband’s
cousin, ‘I have detected you. You made
me miserable whilst he was alive—you
know it—with your bold looks and your
forward manners and your shameless,
open attentions; but it is my turn now,
and before your husband I will tell you
that—’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush, Justina!’ I exclaimed,
fearful what revelation might not be
coming next. ‘You are forgetting yourself;
this is no time for such explanations.
Remember what lies upstairs.’</p>

<p>‘Let her go on,’ interposed Lady
Amabel Scott, with wide-open, astonished
eyes; ‘I am not afraid. I wish to hear of
what she accuses me.’</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat as soon as
she understood the purport of the widow’s
speech, and crossed over to her husband’s
side; and knowing what I did of her, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
was yet glad to see that Warden Scott
threw his arm about her for encouragement
and support. She may have been
thoughtless and faulty, but she was so
young, and <i>he</i> was gone. Besides, no
man can stand by calmly and see one
woman pitted against another.</p>

<p>‘Of what do you accuse me?’ demanded
Lady Amabel, with heightened colour.</p>

<p>‘Of what do I accuse you?’ almost
screamed Justina. ‘Of perfidy, of treachery,
toward him,’ pointing to Mr Warden
Scott, ‘and toward me. I accuse you of
attempting to win my dear husband’s affections
from me—which you never did, thank
God!—and of rendering this home as desolate
as it was happy. But you failed—you
failed!’</p>

<p>‘Where are your proofs?’ said the other
woman, quietly.</p>

<p>‘<i>There!</i>’ exclaimed my niece, as she
threw some four or five letters down upon
the table—‘there! I brought them for
your husband to peruse. <i>He</i> kept them;
generous and good as he was, <i>he</i> would
have spared you an open exposure, but I
have no such feelings in the matter. Are
you to go from this house into another to
pursue the same course of action, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
with better success? No, not if I
can prevent it!’</p>

<p>Her jealousy, rage, and grief seemed
to have overpowered her; Justina was
almost beside herself. I entreated her to
retire, but it was of no avail. ‘Not till
Warden Scott tells me what he thinks of
his wife writing those letters with a view
to seducing the affections of a married
man,’ she persisted.</p>

<p>Mr Scott turned the letters over carelessly.</p>

<p>‘They are not from my wife,’ he quietly
replied.</p>

<p>‘Do <i>you</i> dare to say so?’ exclaimed
Justina to Lady Amabel.</p>

<p>‘Certainly. I never wrote one of them.
I have never written a letter to Harry
since he was married. I have never had
any occasion to do so.’</p>

<p>The widow turned towards me with an
ashen-grey face, which it was pitiful to behold.</p>

<p>‘Whose are they, then?’ she whispered,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>‘I do not know, my dear,’ I replied;
‘surely it matters little now. You will
be ill if you excite yourself in this manner.
Let me conduct you back to your room;’
but before I could do so she had fallen in
a fit at my feet. Of course, all then was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
hurry and confusion, and when I returned
to the drawing-room I found Lady Amabel
crying in her husband’s arms.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Warden dear,’ she was saying, ‘I
shall never forgive myself. This all comes
of my wretched flirting. It’s no good your
shaking your head; you know I flirt, and
so does every one else; but I never meant
anything by it, darling, and I thought all
the world knew how much I loved you.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a goose!’ replied her husband,
as he put her gently away from him;
‘but if you think I’m going to let you remain
in this house after what that d—d
woman—Oh, here is General Wilmer!
Well, General, after the very unpleasant
manner in which your niece has been entertaining
us, you will not be surprised to
hear that I shall take my wife away from
Durham Hall to-night. When Lady Trevor
comes to her senses you will perhaps
kindly explain to her the reason of our
departure, for nothing under such an insult
should have prevented my paying my
last respects to the memory of a man who
never behaved otherwise than as a gentleman
to either of us.’</p>

<p>I apologised for Justina as best I was
able, represented that her mind must really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
have become unhinged by her late trouble,
and that she would probably be very sorry
for what she had said by-and-by; but I
was not surprised that my arguments had
no avail in inducing Mr Scott to permit
his wife to remain at Durham Hall, and in
a few hours they had left the house. When
they were gone I took up the letters, which
still lay upon the table, and examined
them. They were addressed to Sir Harry,
written evidently in a woman’s hand, and
teemed with expressions of the warmest
affection. I was not surprised that the
perusal of them had excited poor Justina’s
wrathful jealousy. Turning to the signatures,
I found that they all concluded with
the same words, ‘Your loving and faithful
Pet.’ In a moment my mind had flown
back to the dying speech of poor Sir
Harry, and had absolved Lady Amabel
Scott from all my former suspicions. She
was not the woman who had penned these
letters; she had not been in the last
thoughts of her cousin. Who, then, had
been? That was a mystery on which
Death had set his seal, perhaps for ever.
Before I retired to rest that night I inquired
for my poor niece, and heard that
she had Mrs Benson with her. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
glad of that: the women were fond of one
another, and Justina, I felt, would pour all
her griefs into the sympathising ear of the
professor’s wife, and derive comfort from
weeping over them afresh with her. But
after I had got into bed I remembered
that I had left the letters lying on the
drawing-room table, where they would be
liable to be inspected by the servants, and
blow the breath of the family scandal far
and wide. It was much past midnight,
for I had sat up late, and all the household,
if not asleep, had retired to their own
apartments; and so, wrapping a dressing-gown
about me, and thrusting my feet into
slippers, I lighted my candle, and descended
noiselessly to the lower apartments.
But when I reached the drawing-room
the letters were gone: neither on the
table nor the ottoman nor the floor were
they to be seen; and so, vexed at my
own carelessness, but concluding that the
servants, when extinguishing the lights,
had perceived and put the papers away in
some place of safety, I prepared to return
to my own room.</p>

<p>The bedrooms at Durham Hall were
situated on either side of a corridor, and
fearful of rousing the family or being caught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in <i>deshabile</i>, I trod on tiptoe, shading my
candle with my hand. It was owing to
this circumstance, I suppose, that I had
reached the centre of the corridor without
causing the least suspicion of my presence;
but as I passed by the apartment where
the remains of my unfortunate host lay
ready for burial, the door suddenly opened
and a light appeared upon the threshold.
I halted, expecting to see emerge the figure
of my widowed niece, but lifting my eyes,
to my astonishment I encountered the
shrinking, almost terrified, gaze of the
professor’s wife. Robed in her night-dress,
pallid as the corpse which lay within,
her large frightened eyes apparently the
only living things about her, she stood
staring at me as though she had been
entranced. Her brown hair floated over
her shoulders, her feet were bare; one
hand held a lighted candle, the other
grasped the packet of letters of which I
had been in search. So we stood for a
moment regarding one another—I taking
in these small but important details; she
looking as though she implored my mercy
and forbearance. And then I drew back
with the gesture of respect due to her
sex, and, clad in her white dress, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
swept past me like a startled spirit and
disappeared.</p>

<p>I gained my own room, but it was not
to sleep. A thousand incidents, insignificant
in themselves, but powerful when
welded into one, sprang up in my mind to
convince me that Justina and I and everybody
had been on a wrong tack, and
that in the professor’s wife, the ‘quiet-looking
little lady’ with her Quaker-like
robes, downcast eyes and modest appearance,
in the ‘best friend’ that my niece
had ever possessed, I had discovered the
writer of those letters, the concealed visitor
in Sir Harry’s room, the ‘Pet’ whose name
had been the last sound heard to issue
from his dying lips. For many hours I
lay awake pondering over the best course
for me to pursue. I could not bear the
thought of undeceiving my poor niece,
whose heart had already suffered so much;
besides, it seemed like sacrilege to drag to
light the secrets of the dead. At the same
time I felt that Mrs Benson should receive
some hint that her presence in Durham
Hall, at that juncture, if desired, was no
longer desirable. And the next day, finding
she was not likely to accord me an
interview, I made the reception of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
missing letters a pretext for demanding
one. She came to her room door holding
them in her hand, and the marks of trouble
were so distinct in her face that I had to
summon all my courage to go through the
task which I considered my duty.</p>

<p>‘You found these in the drawing-room
last night?’ I said, as I received them from
her.</p>

<p>‘I did,’ she answered, but her voice
trembled and her lips were very white.
She seemed to know by instinct what was
coming.</p>

<p>‘And you went to find them because
they are your own?’ She made no answer.
‘Mrs Benson, I know your secret, but I
will respect it on one condition—that you
leave the Hall as soon as possible. You
must be aware that this is no place for
you.’</p>

<p>‘I never wished to come,’ she answered,
weeping.</p>

<p>‘I can believe it, but for the sake of
your friend, of your husband, of yourself,
quit it as soon as possible. Here are your
letters—you had better burn them. I
only wished to ascertain that they were
yours.’</p>

<p>‘General Wilmer—’ she commenced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
gaspingly, and then she turned away and
could say no more.</p>

<p>‘Do you wish to speak to me?’ I asked
her gently.</p>

<p>‘No—nothing; it is useless,’ she
answered with a tearless, despairing grief
which was far more shocking to behold
than either Justina’s or Lady Amabel’s.
‘He is gone, and there is nothing left;
but thank you for your forbearance—and
good-bye.’</p>

<p>So we parted, and to this day, excepting
that she is released from all that could
annoy or worry her, I have learned nothing
more. How long they loved, how much
or in what degree of guilt or innocence, I
neither know nor have cared to guess at;
it is sufficient for me that it was so, and
that while Justina was accusing the beautiful
Lady Amabel Scott of attempting to
win her husband’s heart from her, it had
been given away long before to the woman
whom she termed her dearest friend—to
the woman who had apparently no beauty,
or wit, or accomplishments with which to
steal away a man’s love from its rightful
owner, but who nevertheless was his ‘loving
and faithful Pet,’ and the last thought
upon his dying lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>Professor and Mrs Benson never returned
to Durham Hall. It was not long afterwards
that I heard from my niece that his
wife’s failing health had compelled the professor
to go abroad; and to-day she writes
me news from Nice that Mrs Benson is
dead. Poor Pet! I wonder if those
scared brown eyes have lost their frightened
look in heaven?</p>

<p>I believe that Justina has made an
ample apology for her rudeness to Lady
Amabel and Mr Warden Scott. I know I
represented that it was her duty to do so,
and that she promised it should be done.
As for herself, she is gradually recovering
from the effects of her bereavement, and
finding comfort in the society of her sons
and daughters; and perhaps, amongst the
surprises which I have already spoken of
as likely to await us in another sphere,
they will not be least which prove how
very soon we have been forgotten by those
we left in the world behind us.</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A couple of springs ago, business
compelling some friends of
mine to cross over into Spain,
I gladly accepted the cordial
invitation they extended to me to visit
with them that ‘splendid realm of old
romance.’</p>

<p>Our destination was Utrera, a small
town situated between Seville and Xeres,
and lying in the midst of those vast plains
so often mentioned in the <i>Conquest of
Granada</i>.</p>

<p>I confess that I was rather disappointed
to find how hurriedly we passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Madrid and Seville, and I longed to be
permitted to linger for a little space within
their walls; but ours was not entirely a
party of pleasure, and a diversion was soon
created in my thoughts by our arrival at
Utrera, which, from a distance, presented
a most Oriental appearance. The houses,
many of which are built in the Moorish
fashion and dazzlingly white, stand out
clearly defined against the deep blue southern
sky; the tall tower of Santiago, with
little perhaps but its unusual height to
recommend it to a stranger’s notice, has,
nevertheless, an imposing appearance; and
even a palm tree, which, solitary and alone,
rears its stately head in the centre of the
town, puts in its claim for adding in no
small degree to the effect of the whole
picture. Notwithstanding, with all the
combined advantages of white houses, tall
towers, solitary palm trees and romantic
situations, I would advise no one who is
not a traveller at heart or intent upon his
worldly profit to fix his residence in this
primitive little Andalusian town.</p>

<p>We first took up our quarters at the
posada, with the intention of remaining
there during our stay, but were soon obliged
to abandon the idea, for, though the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
best inn in Utrera, it was most uncomfortable,
and noisy beyond description.</p>

<p>We began to look about us, therefore,
and were soon installed in a small but
beautifully clean and cool-looking house in
a street leading out of the plaza, and
found no reason to be discontented with
our abode. It boasted of a pleasant patio
(or inner courtyard) and a wide verandah
or gallery, into which our rooms opened.
As the days grew warmer (and very warm
indeed they grew after a while) this patio
was our greatest comfort; for, following
the example of our neighbours, we had it
covered with an awning, and spent the
greater part of the day, seated with our
books or work, beside its mimic fountain.
But if we gained in material comfort by
exchanging the noisy and dirty posada for
apartments of our own, we had also drawn
down upon ourselves the burden of housekeeping,
which we found in Spain to be no
sinecure. Some friends who had resided
a few months in the town, and acquired a
fair knowledge of the language, manners,
and customs of the natives of Utrera,
volunteered to send us a maid, warranted
honest and a tolerable proficient in the art
of cookery. But she proved a care-full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
blessing. To give her her due, she possessed
one good quality, and we found by
experience that it was about the only one
she or her sisterhood could boast of: she
was very fond of water. The floors of our
new house were formed of stone, partially
covered by strips of matting which were
easily removed; and we soon lived in a perpetual
swamp. Antonia was always both
ready and willing to ‘clean up,’ and never
seemed happier than when dashing water
in all directions, or brushing away vigorously
at the matting with her little short-handled
broom.</p>

<p>By the way, I wonder why Spanish
women prefer to bend double over their
sweeping, instead of adopting our easier
method of performing the same operation?
In vain did I strive to convince Antonia
of the advantages attendant on the use of
a broom with a long handle: she only
smiled, shook her head, and went obstinately
on her weary way.</p>

<p>The water for our own consumption was
drawn daily from the Moorish aqueduct
just outside the town, and brought to us
by the aguador, an old fellow who wore a
rusty black velvet turban hat stuck full of
cigarettes, besides having one always in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
his mouth. He would pour the water
from his wooden barrels into a large butt
which stood in the kitchen; but as we
discovered that he (together with all who
felt so inclined) dipped his glass, with the
fingers that held it, into the reservoir
whenever he wished to quench his thirst,
we speedily invested in a filter.</p>

<p>We soon found that it was utterly impossible
to infuse any ideas of cookery or
housework into the head of the fair Antonia.
If we showed her how to lay the
tablecloth and place the dishes, she eyed
us with surprise, bordering on contempt,
that ladies should perform such menial
offices; and the next day all our instructions
were as though they had never been.
It was the same with everything, until we
decided that it was far less trouble to wait
on ourselves, and our life at Utrera resolved
itself into a picnic without an end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when we arose one morning
to find that Antonia (wearied perhaps
of English suggestions) had quietly walked
off and left us to shift entirely for ourselves,
we felt inclined to think that we
had undervalued her. But she had received
her wages on the day before, and
we learned afterward that under those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
circumstances it is a common thing for
Spanish servants to quit their places without
any warning, and return home for a
while to live at their ease on the produce
of their labour.</p>

<p>Our next attendant was Pepa, a bright,
dark-eyed girl, who always looked so picturesque,
with a spray of starry jessamine
or scarlet verbena coquettishly placed in
her black hair, that it was impossible not
to overlook her misdemeanours. She had
such an arch way of tossing her head and
shaking her long gold earrings that there
was no resisting her; and indeed Pepa
was but too well aware of the fact herself,
and made the best use of her knowledge.</p>

<p>But the dinners were still our <i>bêtes noirs</i>,
and in these, notwithstanding all her prettiness,
she could help us little better than
her predecessor. The meat which we
procured was simply uneatable, but happily
animal food is little needed in those southern
climes, and we had plenty of game.
Hares, partridges, and wild ducks were
most abundant; and a woman used constantly
to call on us with live quails for
sale, which she would despatch by sticking
one of their own feathers into their brains.</p>

<p>Of course, everything was more or less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
spoiled which we entrusted to the tender
mercies of our handmaid; but fortunately
there were no epicures amongst us, and
we generally received the goods the gods
provided with contentment if not gratitude,
and had many resources to turn to
in order to eke out a distasteful meal. The
bread was excellent, and we always had
an abundance of oranges, chestnuts, melons,
and pomegranates; so that, under the circumstances,
we were not to be pitied.</p>

<p>But one day Pepa, disheartened by her
repeated failures, begged to be allowed to
serve us a Spanish dinner, after tasting
which, she affirmed, we should never desire
to eat any other; and having received
the permission of her mistress, she set to
work, and at the usual hour triumphantly
placed the national dish of ‘puchero’ upon
the table. We gathered round it rather
doubtfully, but after the first timid trial
pronounced it ‘not so bad, though rather
rich.’ It seemed to contain a little of
everything—beef, lard, garlic, garbanzos
(or small, hard beans), lettuce, pepper,
potatoes, and I know not what besides;
and the mixture had been kept simmering
in an earthenware pot for hours. The
next dish served by Pepa was ‘gaspacho,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
or a Spanish salad, which is mixed quite
differently from an English one, and to
most tastes not so palatable. And then
she placed before us a large dish of rice,
profusely sprinkled with cinnamon, and
various small cakes fried in oil; and
Pepa’s Spanish dinner (which, by the way,
was only a sample, I suppose, of the most
ordinary national fare) was concluded.</p>

<p>We were thankful that it had been sufficiently
good to enable us to praise it
enough to give her satisfaction, though we
were compelled to adopt more than one
ruse in order, without hurting her feelings,
to escape having the same feast repeated
every day.</p>

<p>There are not many ‘lions’ in Utrera,
but, such as they are, of course we visited
them. The principal one perhaps is in
the vaults beneath the church of Santiago,
but we were scarcely prepared for the
ghastly spectacle which met our gaze there.
It appears that, many years ago, while
digging for some purpose round the church,
the workmen found several bodies, which,
owing to some peculiar quality of the soil
in which they had been buried, were in
a wonderful state of preservation; and, by
order of the authorities, they were placed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
in upright positions against the walls of
the church vaults. The old sacristan, who
acted as our cicerone, pointed out the
bodies to us with his lighted torch, and
directed our attention especially to one,
evidently that of a very stout woman,
which had still a jacket and skirt clinging
to it. Strange to say, the bodies were all
clothed, although in most cases it had
become difficult to distinguish the garments
from the remains, for all seemed to
partake of the same hue and texture. It
is a humbling sight to look upon the dead
after they have turned again to their dust,
and with but a semblance of the human
frame left clinging to them, as though in
mockery of our mortality. We could not
bear to see the idlers who had followed our
party down into the vaults jeering at the
appearance of these poor carcases, and
touching them in a careless and irreverent
manner. Had we had our way, they
should all have been tenderly consigned
again to the bosom of their mother earth,
and we experienced a strange sensation of
relief as we turned our backs upon them
and emerged once more into the open air.</p>

<p>The principal object of a stroll in Utrera
is a visit to the Church of Consolation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
which stands on the outskirts of the town,
at the end of a long walk bordered with
lines of olive trees. At intervals along the
way benches are placed, and here on Sundays
and feast-days the inhabitants congregate
as they come to and from the church.
The latter is an interesting edifice, though
its architecture is unpretending enough.</p>

<p>Its nave is lofty, and on the whitewashed
walls hang hundreds of little
waxen and silver limbs, and effigies, with
articles of children’s clothing and an endless
assortment of plaited tails of hair.
These are all offerings made to ‘Our Lady
of Consolation,’ in fulfilment of vows or
as tokens of thanksgiving for recovery
from sickness; and there is something
very touching in the idea of these women
giving up their most cherished possessions
(for every one knows how justly proud the
Spanish are of their magnificent hair) as
tributes of gratitude to her from whom
they have received the favours.</p>

<p>The walls near the western door of the
Church of Consolation are hung with innumerable
pictures, each bearing so strong
a resemblance to the other, both in style
and subject, that they might have been
drawn by the same hand. As works of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
art they are valueless, for even the rules
of perspective are ignored in a most
comical manner, and with slight variations
they all represent the same subject. On
one hand is an invalid man, woman or
child, as the case may be, and on the other
a kneeling figure imploring aid for them
of the ‘Virgin of Consolation,’ who is also
portrayed appearing to the suppliant, and
encircled by a golden halo. Beneath the
painting is inscribed the name of the
patient, the nature of his disease, and the
date of his recovery.</p>

<p>At the back of the church is a large
garden belonging to one of the richest proprietors
in the neighbourhood of Utrera,
and as the midday heat became more oppressive
it was a favourite haunt of ours
during the cool of the evening, when the
air was laden with the perfume of orange
blossoms and other sweet-smelling flowers.
The owners of the garden permitted
it to grow wild, but that circumstance
only enhanced its beauty. The orange
trees were laden with golden fruit, of which
we were courteously invited to gather as
much as we pleased. But our visits to
this charming retreat were necessarily
short, for, as in most southern latitudes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
there was scarcely any twilight in
Utrera, and it always seemed as though
the ringing of the Angelus were a signal
for the nights immediately to set in. But
what glorious nights they were! The
dingy oil-lamps in the streets (for gas is
an innovation which had not yet found its
way there) were little needed, as the sky
always seemed to be one bright blaze of
beautiful stars.</p>

<p>The cemetery at Utrera is a quiet spot,
surrounded by a high white wall and thickly
planted with cypress trees, which give it
a most solemn and melancholy appearance.
They have the custom there (I am not
sure it is not prevalent in other parts
of Spain) of burying the dead in recesses
in the walls, which are built expressly of
an immense thickness; the coffins are
shoved into these large pigeon-holes, and
the opening is closed with a marble slab,
which bears the inscription usual in such
cases, somewhat after the fashion of open-air
catacombs. But little respect seemed
to be shown to the dead.</p>

<p>One day I met some children bearing a
bier, upon which was stretched the corpse
of a little girl clothed in white garments,
and with a wreath of flowers placed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the placid brow. The children, apparently
quite unaware of the reverence due to
their sacred burden, carelessly laughed and
chatted as they bore it along the highway,
sometimes sitting down to rest, and then
hurrying forward with unseemly haste, as
though to make up for lost time. A tall
man, wrapped in a huge cloak, and who
evidently belonged to the little <i>cortège</i>,
followed at a distance, but he too performed
the duty at his leisure, and seemed to find
nothing extraordinary or out of the way
in the children’s want of decorum.</p>

<p>With the exception of periodical visits
to the Church of Consolation before mentioned,
the people of Utrera rarely seemed
to leave their houses. To walk for the
sake of walking is an idea which finds
little favour with a Spanish lady, and my
friends and myself were looked upon as
very strange beings for taking so much
exercise and caring to explore the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>But to our English taste it was pleasant
to stroll up the Cadiz road until we reached
a small mound situated thereon, which was
belted with shady trees and amply provided
with stone seats. This elevation commanded
the view of a vast extent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
country, with the grand frowning hills of
the Sierra Nevada in the far distance,
which the gorgeous sunsets always invested
with a strange, unearthly beauty.
The intense solitude of the scene, too, was
not without its own peculiar charm. At
intervals the silence would be broken by
the approach of a picturesque-looking
peasant bestriding a mule, the silvery
jangle of whose bells had been heard in
the calm atmosphere for some time before
he made his personal appearance. These
muleteers never failed to interrupt the
monotonous chants they are so fond of
singing, to wish us a friendly ‘Buenas
tardes’ (‘Good evening’) while proceeding
on their way, and then we would listen to
the sound of the mule’s bells and the
low rich voice of his master until both
died away in the distance, and the scene
resumed its normal condition of undisturbed
tranquility.</p>

<p>We made an expedition once, by the
new railroad, to Moron, a very old town
perched on an almost perpendicular rock
and visible for miles distant. The heat
was intense, but we toiled manfully up the
steep and execrably-paved street from the
station, and, weary and footsore, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
thankful to find ourselves within the cool
walls of the fine old church. It possesses
some valuable Murillos—one of which,
representing the head of our Blessed Lord,
is especially beautiful. The altar-rails,
screen and reredos are all richly gilt, and
the sacristan, taking us into the vestry, unlocked
several massively carved chests,
which disclosed some valuable plate and
precious stones; referring to which, he
boasted, with pardonable pride, that Utrera
could not produce anything half so handsome.
And indeed the inhabitants of
Moron may well congratulate themselves
on these treasures having escaped the
grasp of the French during the war,
for the sacristan related to us how
everything had been hidden away and
miraculously preserved from the hands
of the spoiler.</p>

<p>But my chit-chat is drawing to a close.
It was not without a certain regret that we
bade farewell to Utrera, for during the
whole of our stay there we had experienced
nothing but kindness from all with whom
we had come in contact, and the memory
of our sojourn in that little out-of-the-way
Andalusian town, if not fraught with
brilliant recollections, will, at all events<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
take its rank with that portion of the past
which has been too peaceful to rise up
again to trouble us. And it were well if
we could say the same for every part of our
storm-ridden lives.</p>

</div>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Apparently, there has been
much to say and write lately
upon domestic economy. From
the time, indeed, that the question
of the possibility of marriage upon
three hundred a-year was mooted, the
subject has never fairly been dropped.</p>

<p>Men with incomes of less than three
hundred a-year do not seem to like the
idea, that they are bound in consequence to
renounce all thoughts of matrimony, and
inquiries respecting the matter from aggrieved
bachelors are constantly cropping
up in those corners of the weekly papers
devoted to correspondence. They have
even gone so far lately as to suggest, since
it seems impossible in this century of riots
and rinderpest to curtail one’s expenses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
whether it may not be both lawful and
feasible to curtail one’s family.</p>

<p>The question of, on how much, or on
how little, a certain number of persons can
exist, is certainly one which affects the
mass, but which, to be answered with fairness,
must be put individually. There are
women and women. What one housekeeper
can accomplish on three hundred a-year,
another cannot effect on three thousand,
for it is not incompatible with many
luxuries to possess very little comfort; and
comfort is, after all, the essence of domestic
felicity.</p>

<p>Yet, it is not fair to lay the whole blame of
the impossibility of marriage in these days
upon a moderate income, on the extravagance
of women, for the difficulty is just as
often attributable to the disinclination of
men to resign the luxuries to which they
have been accustomed. For every really
extravagantly disposed female mind there
may be found two thriftily disposed ones;
and had such minds but been endued with
the proper knowledge to carry out their
efforts to do well, existence might not be
found so difficult a matter as it appears to
be at present.</p>

<p>It is true that the ‘girl of the period’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
(not the <i>Saturday Reviewer’s</i> ‘girl’ by any
manner of means), is, generally, better
dressed and more accustomed to luxury
than her mother was before her. But it
must be remembered that the expenses of
a girl before marriage are regulated by the
wishes of her parents, and because they
like to see her sail about in the last Parisian
fashion, it by no means follows that she
will always expect to be dressed the same,
or that she will not cheerfully resign some
of the luxuries she has been accustomed
to, to meet the means of the man who has
taken it upon himself to support her.</p>

<p>Apropos of which I have far oftener
been called upon to remonstrate with
newly-married female friends on their folly
in stripping the trousseaux, which had been
prepared for them with such care, of all
their pretty trimmings of lace and ribbon
and embroidery, in order to adorn the little
frocks and caps which are scarcely ever
noticed but by the mother herself, than to
blame them for outrunning their husbands’
means in order to procure such vanities.</p>

<p>Various reasons may combine to make
the parent, who can afford it, take pleasure
in seeing her daughter well dressed. A
true mother is naturally proud of a girl’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
good looks; and anxious to show them off
to the best advantage; or the feeling that
her child may not long be with her may
make her desirous to please her to the utmost
whilst she remains. Of course, the
indulgence may arise from lower and more
mercenary motives, such as have been attributed
for many a long year to the stereotyped
‘Belgravian mother;’ but even in
such a case it does not follow that the girl
will never be able contentedly to accommodate
herself to a lower range of comfort.
It is not to be expected that, single-handed,
she should put away from her the luxuries
which her parents’ income can command;
but it remains to be proved whether she
will not willingly exchange them to become
the mistress of a house of her own, even
though it may be smaller than the one to
which she has been accustomed. Naturally
parents wish to see the children, for
whom perhaps they have worked and
slaved, comfortably settled in life; and it
is folly for men with barely sufficient money
to keep themselves to rave against fathers
who refuse to sanction their daughters’
starving with them.</p>

<p>But the idea as to what constitutes starvation
has risen with the times. A little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
while ago, it used to be the clergyman with
a large family on eighty pounds a-year: a
twelvemonth back it rose to the celebrated
‘three hundred;’ and but a few weeks
since I heard a lady gravely affirm that
any one who contemplated marriage now-a-days
with an income of less than two
thousand, must be either a madman or a
fool.</p>

<p>Knowing my incompetence for the task,
I have no intention in this paper of trying
to decide on how small a sum it is possible
to maintain a family in this luxurious age.
I only wish to say a few words upon what
I consider to be the secret of the economy
which has need to be exercised in these
days in the largest household as well as in
the smallest.</p>

<p>The order of her household is a true
woman’s battle-field, and the better she
can manage it, the more comforts she can
command, and the more regularity she can
enforce upon a small income and with few
servants, the greater is the triumph of
her victory. If means are unlimited the
triumph is lost; and the woman who has
a thousand a-year for her housekeeping,
and is content to let her husband enjoy no
more luxury upon it than his friend who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
spends five hundred, allowing the surplus
to be wasted for want of a little thought or
supervision, is not a true woman or a good
one. For if prodigality is not a sin in
itself, it arises from the indulgence of a
combination of sins, amongst which selfishness
holds chief rank.</p>

<p>Take the care of her household out of
a woman’s hands and what remains for
her to do? As a generality she would sit
in idleness, for these are not the days
when mothers nurse and look after their
own children, and, thanks to the sewing-machine,
the toil of needlework is over,
even in the poorest families.</p>

<p>She would probably take up a novel the
first thing in the morning, thereby unfitting
herself for any solid work for the remainder
of the day; or she would waste her time
on fancy-work, or unnecessary letter-writing,
or on anything but what sensible
people who know they will be called to
account hereafter for the use they have
made of the brains God has given them
would do.</p>

<p>And, as a rule, I believe few women
would like to be lightened of their trouble
in this respect. The sex is uncommonly
fond of a ‘little brief authority,’ and even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
those who have every aid at their command,
generally choose to dabble in their
housekeeping affairs. And it is just this
‘dabbling’ which does harm, which often
increases the expenses instead of lessening
them.</p>

<p>I am not a second Mrs Warren; I have
no ambition to try and teach my sex how
to manage their husbands, houses and
children on two hundred a-year, by wiping
out the bread-pan every morning with a
clean cloth; and making one stick of wood
do the duty of two by placing it in the
oven to dry the night before.</p>

<p>Mrs Warren’s plan of economy is the
general one; or rather, she follows the
general idea of what economy consists of,
namely, in exercising a constant supervision
over servants, and straining every nerve
to make the leg of mutton last a day longer
than it does with other people. And I for
my part believe that the women of England
will never know the secret of true economy
until they have dropped all such petty
interference with the kitchen, and learned
to guard their husbands’ interests with
their <i>heads</i> instead of their <i>eyes</i>. There
is no doubt that in order to be thrifty it is
necessary in a great measure to limit one’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
expenses, and it is a good plan habitually
to ask oneself before completing a purchase,
‘Can I do without it?’</p>

<p>In nine cases out of ten debts and
difficulties are incurred unnecessarily, for
articles which added neither to our respectability
nor our comfort, and which, if
seriously asked, we should have acknowledged
we could have done just as well
without. Take the generality of English
families, cut off all the superfluities in
which they indulge, all the things which
are necessary neither to their existence
nor their position as gentle-people, and, as
a rule, it will be found that such absorb a
third at least of their income.</p>

<p>It is not only men who have interested
themselves in the questions which have
lately sprung up respecting the general
rise in prices, and the increasing difficulties
which assail the householder. Women are
constantly comparing notes with each
other; wondering ‘where on earth’ the
money can go to, and lamenting the exorbitant
weekly bills they are called upon
to pay.</p>

<p>Some have tried to meet their increased
expenses by diminishing their number of
servants; others by curtailing the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
fare (the worst and most unprofitable species
of domestic economy); a few have gone
another way to work, and simply tried
with how many superfluities they could
dispense; and I think these few have
succeeded the best.</p>

<p>It was much the fashion a short time
back for women to write to the papers
complaining of the worthlessness of their
servants, and it was not until more than
one impertinent letter reflecting on their
mistresses had been published from the
pens (or the supposed pens) of servants
themselves, that the correspondence was
perceived to be <i>infra dig.</i>, and dropped.
We all know that we are very much in the
power of our servants, both as regards
comfort and economy; and to regulate
their actions, we must sway themselves.</p>

<p>As a class, they are much what they
have ever been; their characters varying
with the authority placed over them. If
ignorant, they are bigoted; if educated,
presumptuous; they regard their superiors
as their natural enemies, and not one in
fifty of them is to be entirely trusted.
They no longer look upon the house they
enter as their home; they think of it more
as a boarding-house which they can vacate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
at their convenience, and themselves as
birds of passage, here to-day and gone
to-morrow.</p>

<p>To deal with and to control such minds
effectually, it needs to show them that ours
is infinitely the superior. If we let them
perceive that we have no means of keeping
watch over them except we do it personally,
we lower ourselves to their level,
and fail to gain their respect.</p>

<p>Make your servants admire you; make
them wonder at the clearness of your perception,
the quickness of your calculations,
and the retentiveness of your memory, and
inwardly they will acknowledge themselves
the inferior, and be afraid to disobey.</p>

<p>You will always hear servants speak
with admiration of a mistress who has (to
quote their own phraseology) ‘eyes in her
back;’ the fact being that it requires a
mind not only educated in the popular
sense of the word, but sharpened by friction
with the world, to enable one to <i>perceive</i>
without <i>seeing</i>; and that is a state to which
the lumpish minds of the mass never attain,
and which consequently commands their
wonder and respect.</p>

<p>The ‘excellent housekeeper’ who trots
round her kitchen every morning as a rule,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
opening each dresser-drawer, and uncovering
the soup-tureen and vegetable-dishes,
to see that no ‘perquisites’ are concealed
therein, may occasionally light on a piece
of unhallowed fat, but she loses a hundred-fold
what she gains. While she imagines
she has made a great discovery, her servants
are laughing in their sleeves at her
simplicity; for they have a hundred opportunities
of concealing to her one of finding,
and are doubtless as cunning as herself.
And for such a mistress—for one who is
for ever prying and trying to find out something—the
lower classes have the greatest
contempt; they will neither obey nor save
for her; they will even go the length of
wasting in order to annoy.</p>

<p>But, by this, I have not the least notion
of maintaining that the members of that
community, of whom I said, but a page
before, that not one in fifty is to be trusted,
are to be left to do the housekeeping by
themselves.</p>

<p>A lady of my acquaintance, married to
an extremely obstinate man, was asked
how she managed to influence him as she
did. ‘Because I never let him know I do
it,’ was the reply. ‘I always have my own
way, but I make him think my way is his.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>Something of the same sort of management
is necessary with servants. Have
your own way, but make them imagine
that your way is theirs. They are truly
but ‘children of a larger growth.’</p>

<p>But, in order to do this, you must prove
yourself cleverer than they are.</p>

<p>Let no one grumble at the stir which has
been made lately regarding the improved
education of women, nor that public schools
and colleges are being organised for their
benefit. If the knowledge thus acquired
is never needed for the female doctors,
and lawyers, and members of Parliament,
which, as fixed institutions, England may
never see, it will be only too welcome in
domestic life; for the usual style of conducting
a woman’s education is sadly
detrimental to her interests in housekeeping.</p>

<p>What is the use of their being able to
play and sing and imperfectly splutter
German and Italian, when they are puzzled
by the simplest bookkeeping? Hardly a
woman of modern times thoroughly understands
arithmetic, either mental or otherwise;
and many have forgotten, or never
properly acquired, even the commonest
rules of addition, subtraction, and division.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
How is it to be expected then that they
are fit to be trusted with money, or having
it in their hands to lay it out to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>But to return to ‘head-economy,’ as it
should be exercised with regard to servants.</p>

<p>We will suppose that a mistress, desirous
of keeping within her allowance without
curtailing the real comfort of her husband
and children, has asked herself that simple
question,—‘Can we do without it?’ on
more than one occasion, and found it
answer, in so far that, though several
superfluities, such as dessert after dinner,
and preserves and cakes for tea have disappeared,
all the solid necessaries remain,
and the weekly bills are no longer higher
than they ought to be. How should she
act in order to keep down her expenditure
to a settled sum; to be sure that as much,
but no more than is needful, is used in the
kitchen, the dining-room, and the nursery;
and yet to prevent her servants resenting
her interference, or exclaiming at her
meanness?</p>

<p>It is really very easy, far easier than the
other plan, if women would only believe it
to be so. It needs no store-room full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
hoarded goods, with the key of which the
servants are more familiar than yourself;
no stated times for measuring out half-pounds
of sugar and dispensing tea by
ounces; no running down to the lower
regions a dozen times a day to give out
what may have been forgotten; or to
satisfy oneself whether they really <i>do</i> cut the
joint at the kitchen supper, or revel in fresh
butter when they should be eating salt.</p>

<p>But it does require the knowledge necessary
to keep the housekeeping books properly.
A thorough acquaintance with the
prices of articles, and the different quantities
which a household should consume;
and above all, to have what is commonly
called ‘one’s wits about one.’</p>

<p>If every tradesman with whom you deal
has a running account with you; if nothing
in his book is paid for but what you have
written down yourself; if your cook has
orders to receive no meat without a check;
has proper scales for weighing the joints
as they come in, and makes a note of any
deficiency (the checks being afterwards
compared with the butcher’s book); it is
impossible that the tradespeople can cheat
you, and if your money is wasted, you
must waste it yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>It is an old-fashioned plan to pay one’s
bills at the end of each week; but it is
a very good one. Little things which
should be noticed may slip the memory at
a longer period. Besides, it is a useful reminder;
it shows how the money is going,
and if the tradesmen find you are careful,
it makes them so.</p>

<p>Following this plan, a quarter of an
hour every morning sees the housekeeping
affairs settled for the day, leaving the mistress
at leisure to pursue her own avocations,
and the cook to do her business in
the kitchen. It is simply a glance at the
larder, and then to write down all that will
be required until that time on the morrow;
the dinner and breakfast orders on a slate,
and the other articles in the books appropriated
to them. After a little while it will
be found that the labour is purely mechanical;
in a quiet family the consumption is
so regular that the weekly bills will scarcely
vary, and the mistress’s eye will detect the
least increase, and find out for what it has
been incurred.</p>

<p>At the close of each month the debit
and credit accounts should be balanced,
and then, if the allowance is at any time
exceeded, it will generally be proved that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
it has gone on the superfluities before mentioned,
and not on the actual expense of
maintaining the household. When people
talk of the difficulties of ‘living,’ the
thoughts of their listeners invariably fly
to the cost of bread and meat, and they
unite in abusing the tradespeople, who
send their children to fashionable schools
on the profits which they extort from us.
But there are various ways in which men
and women can save, besides dispensing
with unnecessary eatables.</p>

<p>What woman, for instance, in these
days, buying a dress, does not pay twice
as much for its being made and trimmed
ready for her use as she did for the
original material? And who that has feet
and fingers, and a sewing-machine, could
not sit down and make it in a few hours
for herself?</p>

<p>But she will tell you, most likely, that
she cannot cut out properly, that she has
not the slightest taste for trimming, and
that she was not brought up to dressmaking
like a dressmaker. Ah, my dear
sisters! are not these the days when we
should all learn? <i>Men</i> may go through
life with the knowledge but of one thing—for
if they are acquainted with the duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of their profession, they succeed—but
women need to know <i>everything</i>, from
putting on a poultice to playing the piano;
and from being able to hold a conversation
with the Lord Chancellor, to clear-starching
their husbands’ neckties.</p>

<p>I don’t say we must <i>do it</i>, but I maintain
that we should know how.</p>

<p>Men are really needed but in one place,
and that is, public life; but we are wanted
everywhere. In public and in private,
upstairs and downstairs, in the nursery
and the drawing-room,—nothing can go
on properly without us; and if it does, if
our husbands and our servants and our
children don’t need us, we cannot be doing
our duty.</p>

<p>Above all, we have the training of the
mistresses of future households, and the
mothers of a coming generation—the
bringing up, in fact, of the ‘girls of the
next period.’</p>

<p>If we cannot amend the faults we see in
ourselves (an assertion which should be
paradoxical to anyone gifted with the least
energy), if we think it is too late to sit
down in our middle age, and learn to rub the
rust off our brains, and to work our heads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
with our fingers, we can rear them in a
different fashion.</p>

<p>If we are wasteful and extravagant and
useless—deserving of all the hard things
which have been said of us lately, let us at
least take heed that our daughters are not
the same.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was close upon Easter. The
long, dark days of Lent, with
their melancholy ceremonials,
were nearly over, and, as if in
recognition of the event, the sun was shining
brightly in the heavens. The hawthorn
bushes had broken into bloom, and
the wild birds were bursting their little
throats in gratitude. The boys were almost
as wild and joyous as the birds, as
they rushed about the playground, knocking
each other over in the exuberance of
their glee, and forgetting to be angry in
the remembrance that the next day would
be Holy Thursday, when they should all
go home to their fathers and mothers to
spend the Easter holidays. I alone of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
merry throng sat apart under the quick-set
hedge, joining in neither game nor gaiety,
as I wondered, with the dull, unreasoning
perception of childhood, why I had
been the one selected, out of all that crowd
of boys, to have no part in their anticipation
or their joy. Even poor, lame Jemmy,
who had no remembrance of his father or
his mother, and who had been, in a way,
adopted by our schoolmaster, and lived all
the year round, from January to December,
in the same dull house and rooms, looked
more cheerful than I did. He was incapacitated
by his infirmity from taking
part in any of the noisy games that were
going on around us, yet he smiled pleasantly
as he came limping up towards me
on his crutches, and told me that Mrs
Murray (who bestowed on him all the
mother’s care he would ever know) had
promised, if he were good, to give him a
donkey ride during Easter week, and some
seeds to plant in his strip of garden.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter with you, Charlie?’
he asked presently; ‘aren’t you glad to be
going home?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I don’t care,’ I answered, listlessly.</p>

<p>‘Don’t <i>care</i> about seeing your father and
mother again?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>‘I haven’t got a mother,’ I rejoined,
quickly.</p>

<p>‘Is your mother dead, like mine? Oh,
I <i>am</i> sorry! But your father loves you for
them both, perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘No, he doesn’t! He doesn’t care a bit
about me. He never asks to see me when I
do go home; and he frightens me. I wish
I might stay all the holidays with Mrs
Murray, like you do.’</p>

<p>‘That <i>is</i> bad,’ quoth the lame child.
‘Well, maybe they’ll forget to send for you,
Charlie, and then we’ll have fine times together,
you and I.’</p>

<p>I had not the same hope, however. I
knew that if by any oversight my father
forgot to send the servant for me, that my
schoolmaster would take the initiative and
despatch me home himself.</p>

<p>How I dreaded it. The gloomy, half-closed
house, the garden paths, green with
damp and thick with weeds, the servants
acting entirely upon their own authority,
and the master querulous, impatient, and
unjust, either shut up in his own room
brooding over the past and present, or
freely distributing oaths, complaints, and
sometimes even blows, amongst the unfortunate
inmates of his household. As for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
myself, I seldom came within the range of
his arm without being terrified away, and
it had been a great relief to me when I returned
home for the previous Christmas
holidays to find that he was absent, and the
term of my penance passed peacefully, if
nothing else. But now he was at home
again, so my master informed me, my
father had never dreamt of writing to me,
and I looked forward to the coming visit
with dread. A strange, unnatural state of
things for a child of eight years old,
who had never known a mother’s love
nor care, had never even heard her name
mentioned by any one with whom he was
connected.</p>

<p>‘What was your mother like?’ continued
Jemmy, after a few minutes’ pause, during
which we two unfortunates had been ruminating
upon our lot. ‘Had she light-coloured
hair, like Mrs Murray, or dark,
like the cook?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ I answered, sadly. ‘I
never saw her, that I remember.’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you got a likeness of her at
home?’ he demanded with surprise. ‘Wait
till I show you mine.’</p>

<p>He fumbled about in his waistcoat, and
produced a much faded daguerreotype of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
an ordinary-looking young woman in old-fashioned
habiliments.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t she beautiful?’ he exclaimed, with
weak enthusiasm as he pressed the miniature
to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how I wish she hadn’t died! I
know I should have loved her so much!’</p>

<p>I made no reply. Poor Jemmy’s imagination
did not run so fast as mine. If my
mother had lived to side with my father,
where should I have been between them?
I turned my face away, and sighed.</p>

<p>It was strange that I had no idea of what
my mother had been like. I had never
even formed one, neither had I any relation
to whose memory I might have appealed
on the subject. My father lived a solitary,
aimless life in the old neglected house I
have alluded to, seldom leaving his own
apartments, except at meal times, and certainly
never asking any friend to enter them
to bear him company. The servants had
their parents, or lovers, or brothers, to visit
them by stealth in the kitchen, but the
master sat by himself, gloomy and pre-occupied,
and irritable almost to frenzy
when provoked. No wonder I wished
that I could have spent the Easter holidays
with Mrs Murray. But a great surprise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
was in store for me. The boys had hardly
concluded the game of football they had
been carrying on during my colloquy with
Jemmy, when Mrs Murray came smiling
down the playground in search of me.</p>

<p>‘I’ve a piece of news for you, Master
Vere,’ she exclaimed. ‘Some one is waiting
to see you in the parlour.’</p>

<p>‘Not papa!’ I said, quickly.</p>

<p>‘No; not your papa,’ replied Mrs
Murray, laying her hand compassionately
on my shoulder, ‘but a new friend—a
lady whom you will like very much
indeed.’</p>

<p>‘A <i>lady</i>!’ I repeated, in utter bewilderment,
whilst my schoolmates crowded round
Mrs Murray, with the question, ‘Is she
come to take Vere home?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps! most probably,’ was her
answer, whilst exclamations of, ‘Oh, I say,
that’s a jolly shame. It isn’t fair. School
doesn’t break up till to-morrow. <i>We</i> sha’n’t
get off to-day, try as hard as we may,’
greeted her supposition from every side,
and I, trembling like a culprit, affirmed
that I would much rather not be introduced
to the pleasures of home one hour
earlier than was needful.</p>

<p>‘Come into the parlour, dear, and see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the lady,’ Mrs Murray replied, ‘and we
will decide what to do afterwards.’</p>

<p>So my face and hair were hurriedly
washed and arranged, and I sheepishly
followed my master’s wife to the formal
little apartment dedicated to the reception
of visitors, where we found the lady she
had alluded to.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget her face as she rose
to greet me, and drew me into her arms!
Such a fair, sweet, fresh face as it was, but
with an amount of sorrowful thought pictured
in the serious eyes.</p>

<p>‘And so this is Charlie Vere,’ she said,
as she gazed into my features. ‘I should
have known you anywhere, my darling,
from your likeness to your father! And
now do you guess who I am?’</p>

<p>‘No!’ I answered, shyly; for Mrs
Murray had slipped away and left me
all alone with the stranger.</p>

<p>‘I am your mother, dear; your new
mother who means to love you very dearly,
and I have come to take you home!’</p>

<p>Mother and Home! How sweet the
dear familiar words sounded in my ears;
familiar alas! to everyone but me. The
hawthorn blossoms in the playground
seemed to smell sweeter than they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
done before, as she pronounced them, and
the birds’ chorus rang out harmoniously.</p>

<p>‘Will papa be there?’ I asked, nervously.</p>

<p>‘Papa! of course! What would home
be without your father?’</p>

<p>I had found it much pleasanter without
him than with him hitherto, but some instinct
made me hold my tongue.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you love papa, dear?’ the lady
went on softly. ‘Don’t you think that he
loves you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ I said, picking my fingers.</p>

<p>‘Poor child! Perhaps you have thought
not, but that will all be altered now. But
you have not yet told me if you will like
to have me for a mother!’</p>

<p>‘I think I shall like you very much!’</p>

<p>‘That’s right, so we will go home together
and try to make each other happy.
You want a mother to look after you, dear
child, and I want a little boy to love me.
We will not part again, Charlie, now I
have found you, not for the present, at all
events. You have been too long away
from home as it is. That is why I came
to-day. I could not wait till to-morrow,
even: I was so impatient to see you and
to take you home.’</p>

<p>How she dwelt and lingered on the word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and repeated it, as though it gave her as
much happiness to listen to as it did me.</p>

<p>‘Will <i>you</i> be there?’ I asked, presently.</p>

<p>‘Of course, I shall—always! What
would be the use of a mother, Charlie, if
she didn’t live in the house close to you,
always ready to heal your troubles and
supply your wants to the utmost of her
power?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! let us go at once!’ I exclaimed,
slipping my hand into hers. All dread of
my father seemed to have deserted me.
The new mother was a guardian angel,
under whose protection I felt no fear. She
was delighted with my readiness.</p>

<p>‘So we will, Charlie! We need not
even wait for your box to be packed. Mrs
Murray can send on everything to-morrow.
And papa will be anxious until he sees us
home again!’</p>

<p>My father anxious about me! That was
a new thing to be wondered at. I was too
much of a baby still to perceive that his
anxiety would be for <i>her</i>—not for me! I
had not yet been able to grasp the idea
that she was his wife. I only regarded
her as my new mother.</p>

<p>As we passed out of the house, I asked
leave to say good-bye to my friend Jemmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>‘His mother is dead, like mine,’ I said,
in explanation. ‘He will be so pleased
to hear that I have got a new one.’</p>

<p>‘Poor boy!’ she sighed; ‘we will ask
him to spend the summer holidays with
you Charlie. A great happiness like ours
should make us anxious to make others
happier.’</p>

<p>And when Jemmy came forward on his
crutches, and smiled his congratulations
on the wonderful piece of news I had to
give him, she stooped down and kissed
his forehead. Then we passed out of the
playground together, I clinging to her
hand, and proud already to hear the flattering
comments passed upon her appearance
by the other boys, and to remember that
from that time forward she was to be
called <i>my mother</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Lilyfields, as my father’s house was
designated, was not more than ten or
twelve miles from the school; but we had
to make a little railway journey to reach it,
and I thought I had never travelled so pleasantly
before. My new mother laughed so
often and chatted so continuously to me,
that I caught the infection of her mirthful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
loquacity, and, long before we got home,
had revealed so much of my past life and
feelings, that more than once I brought a
shadow over her sunny face, and closed
her smiling lips with a sigh. But as we
left the train and commenced to walk towards
Lilyfields, my old fears showed
symptoms of returning, and my sudden
silence, with the tightening clasp of my
hand, did not pass unobserved by my
companion.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Charlie? Of what
are you afraid?’</p>

<p>‘Won’t papa be angry with me for
coming back before the holidays begin?’
I whispered.</p>

<p>Her clear laugh rang over the peaceful
meadows we were traversing.</p>

<p>‘If he is angry with any one, he must
be so with me, as I fetched you home
Charlie.’</p>

<p>‘And you are not afraid of him?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Afraid!</i>’ The sweet serious eyes
she turned upon me as she ejaculated the
word were just about to deprecate so
monstrous an idea, when they caught sight
of an approaching figure, and danced with
a thousand little joys instead.</p>

<p>‘There he is!’ she exclaimed excitedly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
She ran up to him, dragging me with
her.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms (there was not
another living soul within sight of us)
and embraced her fervently, whilst I stood
by, open-mouthed with astonishment.</p>

<p>‘My angel,’ he murmured, as she lay
there, with her face pressed close to his;
‘life has been insupportable without you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Harold! it does me good to hear
you say so; and I am so glad to get back
to you again. See! here is Charlie waiting
for his father to welcome him home.’</p>

<p>She lifted me up in her arms—big boy
as I was—and held me towards him for a
kiss. How strange it was to feel my
father kiss me; but he did so, though I
think his eyes never left her face the while.
Then he took her hand, and held it close
against his heart, and they walked through
the silent, balmy-breathed fields together.
As I entered the house I could hardly
help exclaiming aloud at the marvellous
changes that had taken place there. Not
an article of furniture had been changed,
not a picture moved from its place, yet
everything looked bright as the glorious
spring. The rooms had been thoroughly
cleaned, and lace curtains, snowy table-cloths,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
and vases of flowers, with here and
there a bright bit of colour in the shape
of a rug, or a piece of china, had transformed
the house—not into a paradise—but
into <i>a home</i>. Even my father was
changed like his surroundings. He looked
ten years younger, as with nicely kept
hair, and a becoming velveteen lounging
coat, he sunk down into an easy-chair, and
deprecated, whilst he viewed with delight,
the alacrity with which my new mother
insisted upon removing his boots and fetching
his slippers. It was such a novelty
to both of us to be attended to in any way,
that I was as much surprised as he to find
that the next thing she did was to take
me upstairs, and tidy me for tea herself,
showering kisses and love words upon me
all the while. Oh! the happy meal that
followed. How unlike any we had taken
in that house before! I, sitting up at
table, with my plate well provided; my
father in his arm-chair, looking up with
loving eyes at each fresh proof of her solicitude
for him, and my new mother seated
at the tea-tray, full of smiles and innocent
jests, watching us both with the utmost
affection; but apparently too excited to
eat much herself. Once my father noticed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
her want of appetite and reproached her
with it.</p>

<p>‘I am too happy to eat, Harold!’ was
her reply.</p>

<p>‘Too happy,’ he repeated in a low voice,
‘<i>really</i> too happy! No regrets, my Mary,
no fears! Your future does not terrify
you. You would not undo the past if it
were in your power!’</p>

<p>‘Not one moment of it, Harold! If I
ever think of it, with even a semblance of
regret, it is that it did not begin ten years
sooner.’</p>

<p>‘God bless you!’ was all he answered.</p>

<p>If I had not been such a child I should
have echoed the words; for before many
days were over my head, the whole of my
joyous young life was an unuttered blessing
upon her. The darkness of fear and
despondency—the most unnatural feelings
a young child can entertain—had all passed
away. I no longer dreaded my father’s
presence; on the contrary, it was my
greatest treat to bear him company as he
worked in the garden, or whistled over
his carpentering, or accompanied my
mother in strolls about the country.</p>

<p>He never shut himself up in his room
now, unless she was shut in too; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
although his new-born love was for <i>her</i>,
and not for me, the glory of it was reflected
in his treatment of me.</p>

<p>So I was very happy, and so was he,
and so most people would have thought
my mother to be. But though she never
appeared before my father without a bright
face, she was not always so careful in my
presence, thinking me, perhaps, too young
to observe the changes in her countenance;
and sometimes when she and I were alone
together, I marked the same look steal
over her which I had observed on the
occasion of our first meeting—an undercurrent
of thoughtful sadness—the look of
one who had suffered, who still suffered,
from a pain which she kept to herself.</p>

<p>Once I surprised her in tears—a violent
storm of tears, which she was powerless
for some time to control; and I eagerly
inquired the reason of them.</p>

<p>‘Mamma, mamma, what is it, mamma?
Have you hurt your foot? Did Prince
bite you? Have you got a pain anywhere?’</p>

<p>My childish mind could not comprehend
that her tears should flow for any other
than a physical reason. Did not papa and
I love her dearly? and she was afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
no one, and she never went to school.
What possible cause could she have for
tears?</p>

<p>My mother composed herself as soon as
she was able, and laid her burning face
against my cheek.</p>

<p>‘Will my little boy love me always?’
she asked—‘always—always—whatever
happens?’</p>

<p>‘Always, dear mamma. Papa and I
would die if we hadn’t you. Oh, you don’t
know what it was like before you came
here!’</p>

<p>‘Then mamma will never again be so
silly as to cry,’ said my mother, as she
busied herself over some occupation to
divert her thoughts.</p>

<p>But although this was the only time she
betrayed herself so openly before me, I
often detected the trace of weeping on her
face, which she would try to disguise by
excessive mirth.</p>

<p>So the years went on, until one bright
summer’s day a little sister was born in our
house. I hailed the advent of this infant
with the greatest possible delight. It was
such a new wonderful experience to have
a playmate so dependent on me, and yet
so entirely my own. I positively worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
my little sister, although her birth
was the signal for my being sent back to
school, but this time only as a weekly
boarder.</p>

<p>Hitherto my mother had taught me
herself, and very sorry I was to give up
those delightful lessons, which were rendered
so easy by the trouble she took to
explain them to me; but her time was too
much taken up with her baby to allow her
to devote sufficient to me. Besides, I was
now eleven years old, growing a great lad,
and able to take every advantage of the
education afforded me at Mr Murray’s
school.</p>

<p>My old friend, lame Jemmy, who had
spent many a pleasant week at Lilyfields
meanwhile, was still there to welcome me
back and make me feel less of a stranger;
and my father took away the last sting of
the new arrangement by buying me a
sturdy pony on which to ride backwards
and forwards every week to see my mother
and him.</p>

<p>But the greatest pang which I experienced
was parting, even for a few days,
with baby Violet. I cried over her so
much, indeed, that I made my mother cry
too, as she asked God to bless the boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
who had been a true son to her. I was
very glad to think she loved me so much,
for I loved her dearly in return; but as I
galloped back to Lilyfields every Saturday
afternoon, my thoughts were all for the
dimpled baby sister whom I would carry
about in my arms, or roll with amongst the
newly-mown grass, rather than with those
who had proved themselves to be real
parents to me,—she from the commencement
of her knowledge of me, and he from
the date of his knowing her. It was my
mother alone I had to bless for it all.
But I had grown accustomed to happiness
by this time, and took it as my due.</p>

<p>My parents were very proud of their
little daughter, who grew into a lovely
child, but she did not seem to afford them
as much pleasure as pride. Sometimes I
detected my mother looking at her as we
romped together, with more pain in the
expression of her face than anything else.
Once she caught her suddenly to her
bosom, and kissed her golden curls with
passion, exclaiming,—</p>

<p>‘Oh, my heart, if I were to go, what
would become of you?—what <i>would</i>
become of you?’</p>

<p>I was still too young to grasp the full<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
meaning of her words, but I knew my
mother meant that if she died, no one
would take such good care of Violet as she
had done. So I marched up to her confidently,
with the assurance that <i>I</i> would
take that responsibility upon my own
shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be afraid, mamma! As soon as
I am a man, I mean to get a house all to
myself, and the best rooms in it shall be
for Violet.’</p>

<p>She looked at me with her sweet,
earnest, searching gaze for a moment, and
then folded me in one embrace with her
own child.</p>

<p>‘Father’s boy!’ she murmured, caressingly
over me—‘father’s brave, loving
boy! No, Charlie, I will not be afraid!
If it be God’s will that I should go, I will
trust Violet to father and to you.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile my father was a very contented
man. He had undergone much the
same change as myself, and forgotten, in
the sunshine that now surrounded him, all
the miserable years he had spent in that
once desolate mansion.</p>

<p>I do not suppose a happier nor more
peaceful family existed than we were. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
jars nor bickering ever disturbed the quiet
of the household; everything seemed to
go as smoothly as though it had been
oiled. We were like the crew of some
ship, safely moored within a sunny harbour,
never giving a thought to what
tempests might be raging outside the
bar.</p>

<p>Every Saturday when I rode home on
my pony, I found my father either working
out of doors if it were summer, or indoors
if it were winter, but always with the same
satisfied easy smile upon his countenance,
as though he had no trouble in the world,
as indeed he had not; for my mother
warded off the most trifling annoyance
from him as though he were a sick child,
that must not be upset; whilst she threaded
her quiet way through the kitchen and
bedrooms, with little Violet clinging to her
gown, regulating the household machinery
by her own supervision, that no accident
might occur to ruffle her husband’s
temper.</p>

<p>I believed her in those days—I believe
her still to be the noblest woman ever
planned. One thing alone puzzled me—or
rather, I should say, seemed strange
to me, for I did not allow it to go the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
length of puzzlement—and that was why
we had so few visitors at Lilyfields. True,
my father had made himself so unsociable
in the old days that strangers might well
have been shy of intruding themselves
upon him now; but my mother was so
sweet and gentle, I felt it must be their
loss rather than hers, that so few people
knew her. When, as a lad of fifteen, I
mentioned this circumstance to her, she
put it aside as a matter of course.</p>

<p>‘When I made up my mind, Charlie, to
try as far as in me lay, to render the
remainder of your father’s life happy, I
was perfectly aware that I should have to
depend for companionship upon him alone.
We have each other, and we have you and
Violet. We want no other society but
yours.’</p>

<p>Still, I thought the clergyman and his
wife might sometimes have come to see us,
as they did the rest of their parishioners,
and I should have liked an occasional
game of play with the sons of Squire
Roberts up at the Hall. But, with the
exception of the doctor, who sometimes
came in for a chat with my father, no
one but ourselves ever took a meal at
Lilyfields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>As I grew still older, and others
remarked on the circumstance in my hearing,
I came to the conclusion that my
father must have offended his own friends
by marrying my mother, whose connections
might be inferior to his own. This idea
was confirmed in my mind by observing
that she occasionally received letters she
was anxious to conceal, which, knowing
the frankness of her disposition, and her
great love for him, appeared very strange
to me. One day, indeed, my suspicions
became almost certainties. It so happened
that my mother had appeared very fidgety
and unlike herself at the breakfast-table,
and more than once had spoken to Violet
and me in a voice hardly to be recognised
as her own. We felt instinctively that
something was the matter, and were silent,
but my father, who was not well, seemed
irritated by the unusual annoyance. He
wished to remain quietly at home that
morning, but my mother found a dozen
reasons why he should ride to the neighbouring
town and take me with him. He
combatted her wish for some time, till,
finding that her arguments were revolving
themselves into entreaty, his affection conquered
his irresolution, and we set off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
together. It was not a genial day for a
ride, and the trifling commissions my
mother had given us to execute were not
of sufficient consequence to turn the duty
into a pleasure. I was rather pleased than
otherwise, therefore, when we had left
Lilyfields some miles behind us, to find
that my pony had cast a shoe, and to be
able, according to my father’s direction, to
turn back and walk it gently home again,
whilst he went forward to do my mother’s
bidding.</p>

<p>When I reached Lilyfields I left the
animal in the stables, and, walking up to
the house, gained the hall before anyone
was sensible of my approach. What was
my surprise to hear a loud altercation going
on within the parlour. My first impulse
was to open the door; but as my mother
turned and saw me standing on the threshold,
she came forward and pushed me back
into the hall.</p>

<p>‘Go away!’ she whispered hurriedly; ‘go
upstairs; hide yourself somewhere, and do
not come down until I call you!’</p>

<p>Her eyes were bright as though with
fever, and a scarlet spot burned on either
cheek. I saw she was labouring under
the influence of some strong excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and I became intensely curious to learn
the reason.</p>

<p>‘Whom have you in there?’ I demanded,
for I had caught sight of another figure in
the drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘Oh! you wish to know who I am,
young man, do you?’ exclaimed a coarse,
uncertain voice from the other side the half-opened
door. ‘Well, I’m not ashamed of
myself, as <i>some</i> people ought to be, and
you’re quite welcome to a sight of me if
it’ll give you any pleasure.’</p>

<p>The door was simultaneously pulled
open, and a woman stood before me.</p>

<p>How shall I describe her.</p>

<p>She may have been beautiful, perhaps,
in the days long past, but all trace of
beauty was lost in the red, blotchy,
inflamed countenance she presented to my
gaze. Her eyes were bloodshot; her hair
dishevelled; her dress tawdry and untidy,
and if she had even been a gentlewoman,
which I doubted, she had parted with
every sign of her breeding. As she
pushed her way up behind my mother—looking
so sad and sweet and ladylike
beside her—she inspired me with nothing
but abhorrence.</p>

<p>‘Who is this person?’ I repeated, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
an intimation of disgust that apparently
offended the stranger, for in a shrill voice
she commenced some explanation which
my mother was evidently most anxious
I should not hear.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Charlie! do you love me?’ she
whispered.</p>

<p>‘Mother! yes!’</p>

<p>‘Then go up to your room, now, <i>at
once</i>, and wait there till I come to you!
I will speak to you afterwards—I will tell
you <i>all</i>—only go now!’</p>

<p>She spoke so earnestly that I could not
refuse her request, but did as she desired
me at once, the woman I had seen,
screaming some unintelligible sentence
after me as I ascended the stairs. But
when I found myself alone, the scene I
had witnessed recurred rather unpleasantly
to my memory. It was an extraordinary
circumstance to see a stranger at all within
our walls; still more so a woman, and one
who dared to address my mother in loud
and reproachful tones. And I was now
sixteen, able and willing to defend her
against insult, why, therefore, had she not
claimed my services to turn this woman
from the house, instead of sending me
upstairs, as she might have done little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Violet, until she had settled the matter for
herself? But then I remembered the
trouble my mother had taken to get my
father and me away from Lilyfields that
morning, and could not believe but that
she had foreseen this visitation and prepared
against it. It was then as I had
often supposed. She had relations of
whom she was ashamed, with whom she
did not wish my father to come in contact.
Poor mother! If this was one of them, I
pitied her! I believed the story I had
created myself so much, that I accepted it
without further proof, and when my
mother entered the room, and laying her
head against my shoulder, sobbed as if
her heart would break, I soothed her as
well as I was able, without another inquiry
as to the identity of the person with
whom I had found her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t tell your father, Charlie!’ she
said, in parting. ‘Don’t mention a word
to anyone of what you have seen to-day.
Promise me, darling! I shall not
be happy till I have your word for it!’</p>

<p>And I gave her my word, and thought
none the less of her for the secrecy, although
I regretted it need be.</p>

<p>Not long after this my father articled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
me, at my own request, to an architect in
London, and my visits to the happy home
at Lilyfields became few and far between.
But I had the consolation of knowing that
all went well there, and that I was
taking my place in the world as a man
should do.</p>

<p>I had worked steadily at my profession
for two years, and was just considering
whether I had not earned the right to take
a real good long holiday at Lilyfields
(where Violet, now a fine girl of seven
years old, was still my favourite plaything),
when I received a letter from
the doctor of the village—desiring me
to come home at once as my father
was ill, beyond hope of recovery. I knew
what that meant—that he was already
gone; and when I arrived at Lilyfields I
found it to be true; he had died of an
attack of the heart after a couple of hours’
illness. The shock to me was very great.
I had never loved my father as I did my
mother; the old childish recollections
had been too strong for that, but the last
few years he had permitted me to be very
happy, and I knew that to <i>her</i> his loss
must be irreparable. Not that she exhibited
any violent demonstration of grief.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
When I first saw her, I was surprised at
her calmness. She sat beside my father’s
body, day and night, without shedding
a tear; and she spoke of his departure as
quietly as though he had only gone on
a journey from which she fully expected
him to return. But though her eyes were
dry, they never closed in sleep, and every
morsel of colour seemed to have been
blanched out of her face and hands. So
the first day passed, and when the second
dawned, I, having attained the dignity of
eighteen years, thought it behoved me
to speak of my late father’s affairs and my
mother’s future.</p>

<p>‘Where is father’s will, mother?’</p>

<p>‘He never made one, dear!’</p>

<p>‘Never made a will! That was awfully
careless.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, Charlie!’</p>

<p>She would not brook the slightest censure
cast on her dead love.</p>

<p>‘But there <i>must</i> be a will, mother.’</p>

<p>‘Darling, there is none! It was the
one thought that disturbed his last moments.
But I am content to let things
be settled as they may.’</p>

<p>‘Lilyfields will be yours of course, and
everything in it,’ I answered decidedly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
‘No one has a better right to them than
you have. And you and Violet will live
here to your lives’ end, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t ask me, dear Charlie, don’t
think of it—not just yet at least! Let us
wait until—until—it is all over, and then
decide what is best to be done!’</p>

<p>Before it was all over; matters were
decided for us.</p>

<p>It was the day before the funeral. I had
just gone through the mournful ceremony
of seeing my father’s coffin soldered down,
and, sad and dispirited, had retired to my
own room for a little rest, when I heard the
sound of carriage wheels up on the gravel
drive. I peered over the window blind
curiously, for I had never heard of my
father’s relations, and had been unable in
consequence to communicate with any of
them. A lumbering hired fly, laden with
luggage, stopped before the door, and from
it descended, to my astonishment, the same
woman with the fiery red face whom I had
discovered in my mother’s company two
years before. I decided at once that,
whatever the claims of this stranger might
be, she could not be suffered to disturb
the widow in the first agony of her crushing
grief, and, quick, as thought, I ran down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
into the hall and confronted her before
she had entered the house.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, madam,’ I commenced,
‘but Mrs Vere is unable to
see anyone at present. There has
been a great calamity in the family,
and—’</p>

<p>‘I know all about your calamity,’ she
interrupted me rudely ‘if it were not for
that I shouldn’t be here.’</p>

<p>‘But you cannot see Mrs Vere!’ I
repeated.</p>

<p>‘And pray who <i>is</i> Mrs Vere?’ said the
woman.</p>

<p>‘My mother,’ I replied proudly, ‘and
I will not allow her to be annoyed or
disturbed.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! indeed, young man. It strikes
me you take a great deal of authority
upon yourself; but as I mean to be mistress
in my own house, the sooner you
stop that sort of thing the better! Here!
some of you women!’ she continued,
addressing the servants who had come
up from the kitchen to learn the cause of
the unusual disturbance. ‘Just help the
flyman up with my boxes, will you—and
look sharp about it.’</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck at her audacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>For a moment I did not know what to
answer. But when this atrocious woman
walked past me into the parlour, and
threw herself into my dead father’s
chair, I followed her, and felt compelled
to speak.</p>

<p>‘I do not understand what you mean
by talking in this way,’ I said. ‘Mrs
Vere is the only mistress in this house,
and—’</p>

<p>‘Well, young man, and suppose <i>I</i> am
Mrs Vere!’</p>

<p>‘I can suppose no such thing. You
cannot know what you are talking about.
My mother—’</p>

<p>‘<i>Your mother!</i> And pray, what may
your name be and your age?’</p>

<p>‘Charles Vere; and I was eighteen
last birthday,’ I said, feeling compelled,
I knew not by what secret agency, to
reply.</p>

<p>‘Just so! I thought as much! Well, I
am Mrs Vere, and I am your mother!’</p>

<p>‘<i>My mother!</i> You must be mad,
or drunk! How dare you insult the
dead man in his coffin upstairs. My
mother! Why, she died years ago, before
I can remember.’</p>

<p>‘Did she? That’s the fine tale, Madam,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
who’s been taking my place here
all this time, has told you, I suppose. But
I’ll be even with her yet. I’m your father’s
widow, and all he’s left behind him belongs
to me, and she’ll be out of this house before
another hour’s over her head, or my name’s
not Jane Vere!’</p>

<p>‘You lie!’ I exclaimed passionately.
This tipsy, dissipated, coarse-looking creature,
the woman who bore me, and whom
I had believed to be lying in her grave for
sixteen years and more. Was it wonderful
that at the first blush my mind utterly
refused to credit it? The angry accusation
I have recorded had barely left my
lips, when I looked up and saw <i>my mother</i>—the
woman who had come as an angel of
light into my father’s darkened home, and
watched over me with the tenderest affection
since—standing on the threshold, pale
and peaceful in her mourning garb, as the
Spirit of Death itself.</p>

<p>‘Mother! say it is not true,’ I cried as
I turned towards her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Charlie, my darling boy! my
brave, good son! Be quiet! bear it like a
man; but it <i>is</i> true!’</p>

<p>‘This—this woman was my father’s
<i>wife</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>‘She was!’</p>

<p>‘And <i>you</i>, mother!’ I exclaimed in
agony.</p>

<p>‘I was only the woman that he loved,
Charlie,’ she answered, with downcast
eyes. ‘You must think no higher of me
than that!’</p>

<p>‘I think the very highest of you that I
can. You were my father’s loving companion
and friend for years: you saved his
life and his reason! You were <i>his</i> true,
true wife, and <i>my</i> mother. I shall never
think of you in any lower light.’</p>

<p>My emotion had found vent in tears
by that time. It was all so new and
so horrible to believe, and my mother’s
hand rested fondly on my bowed head.</p>

<p>Then that other woman, whose existence
I can never recall without a shudder,
seized her hateful opportunity, and levelled
the most virulent abuse at my poor martyr
mother’s head. Words, such as I had
never heard from a female before, rained
thickly from her lips, until I lost sight
of my own grief in my indignation at
the shower of inuendoes which were being
hurled at the person dearest to me of all
the world.</p>

<p>‘Be silent,’ I said in a loud authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
voice. ‘Were you twenty times my mother
I would not permit you to speak as
you are speaking now. If it is true that
you were my father’s wife, why were you
not in your proper place, instead of leaving
your lawful duties to another?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! madam here can answer that
question better than myself. She knows
well enough there was no room left for
me where she was.’</p>

<p>‘Untrue!’ murmured my mother, but
without any anger. ‘I would have shielded
your character from your boy’s censure, as
I have done for so long, but justice to the
dead compels me to speak. You left this
home desolate for many miserable years
before I entered it. You deserted your
child in his infancy, but your husband had
so good and forgiving a heart that, when
you cried to him for pardon, he took you
back again and condoned your great offence,
and therefore, when you left him a second
time, the law contained no remedy for his
wrong. He was compelled to live on—alone—dishonoured
and comfortless, whilst
you—you can best tell your son what your
life has been since.’</p>

<p>‘Anyway I am Mrs Vere,’ retorted the
other, ‘and my husband has died intestate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and his property belongs to me, so I’ll
thank you to take your brat, and clear
out of my house before the sun goes
down.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! mother, this is infamous! It can
never be!’</p>

<p>‘It <i>must</i> be, Charlie! It is the law. I
knew all this when I consented to come
here as your father’s wife. He never deceived
me for a single moment; and if I
have any regret that he put off providing
against this contingency until it was too
late, it is only for fear lest he should be
regretting it also. But, my dear, <i>dear</i>
love!’ she added in a lower tone, ‘I acquit
you of this as of all things. I know your
great love for me never failed, and I am
content!’</p>

<p>‘I will not believe it without further
proof!’ I exclaimed. ‘I will send Ellen at
once for the solicitor. I cannot leave you
alone with this horrid woman!’</p>

<p>‘Hush, Charlie! she is your mother.’</p>

<p>‘I will not acknowledge it. <i>You</i> are
the only mother I have ever had—the
only mother I ever will have to my
life’s end.’</p>

<p>Mr Chorberry, the solicitor, came without
delay, but he could give me no comfort.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
My poor father, by that strange indifference
which has been the curse of so
many, had put off making his will until it
was too late, by reason of which he had
left the one to whom he owed most in
the world, the woman who had sacrificed
friends and reputation to spend her life in
a dull country home, administering to his
pleasures, entirely dependent on her own
resources for support—whilst the faithless,
drunken creature he had the misfortune to
be still chained to, walked in as the lawful
wife, and claimed her share of the property.
There was only one drop of balm in his
decision. I, as my father’s son, shared
what he had left behind him, but my angel
mother and dear baby-sister were cast upon
the world to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>And this was the law.</p>

<p>Oh, father! did your spirit look down
from whichever sphere it had been translated
to, and witness this?</p>

<p>‘But, surely,’ I said to Chorberry,
‘there can be no necessity for my mother
leaving Lilyfields before the funeral?’</p>

<p>‘Of course there is no necessity; but do
you think it advisable, under the circumstances,
that she should remain? Mrs Vere
has the legal power to enforce her departure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
and I am afraid will not be slow to
use it.’</p>

<p>My mother evidently was of one mind
with him, for in an incredibly short space
of time she had packed her belongings.
Mrs Vere, standing over her meanwhile
to see she did not purloin anything from
the house, and was waiting in the hall with
little Violet, ready to go to the house of the
clergyman’s wife, who, to her honour, having
heard how matters stood at Lilyfields, had
promptly sent my mother an invitation to
the vicarage for the night.</p>

<p>‘Are you ready, dear mother?’ I said
sadly, as I joined her in the hall, and drew
her arm within my own.</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr Charles, I suppose I shall
see you back again here before long?’
screamed the shrill voice of Mrs Vere down
the staircase.</p>

<p>I started.</p>

<p><i>See me back!</i> Was it possible that
this woman believed I intended to make
friends with her?</p>

<p>‘We’ve been parted long enough, it
strikes me,’ she continued; ‘and now your
father’s gone, and left no one behind him but
yourself, I suppose you’ll be looking out
for my share of the property at my death,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
so we may as well let bye-gones be bye-gones—eh?’</p>

<p>‘I wish for none of your property,
madam,’ I answered haughtily, ‘since the
law gives it to you you are welcome to
keep it.’</p>

<p>‘Charlie, dear, think what you may be
resigning,’ urged my mother in my ear.</p>

<p>‘I think of nothing but <i>you</i>, mother!’</p>

<p>‘Hoity, toity! here’s manners,’ cried
the other woman. ‘You seem to forget,
Master Charlie, that <i>I’m your mother</i>!’</p>

<p>Still holding my mother’s hand, I turned
and confronted her.</p>

<p>‘I forget nothing, madam! I wish I
could; but I remember that <i>here</i> stands the
woman who laboured where you refused to
work; who loved, where you had insulted and
betrayed; who was faithful where you were
faithless and undeserving; and, I say, that
here stands my dead father’s true wife; and
here stands, in God’s sight, <i>my mother</i>!
The blessing of man may not have sanctified
her union, but the blessing of heaven
shall be upon it and upon her—upon the
creatures she rescued from a living death
and upon the gracious hand with which she
did it, until time itself shall be no more.’</p>

<p>So saying, I passed with <i>my mother</i> beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the gates of Lilyfields, to make a new
life for her in some quiet spot where she
might outlive her grief, and to repay, if
possible, by the protection and support of
my manhood, the love she had given me
as a little child.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Fever is raging in Brussels, and
we are advised to quit the town
as soon as possible. The question
is, where to go. I suggest
Rochefort in the Ardennes, having ascertained
previously that the place is healthy;
but my friends laugh at me. ‘Rochefort
in February! We shall all be frozen to
death.’ ‘At least,’ I argue, ‘there is pure
air to breathe.’ ‘But you can have no
idea of the dulness,’ is all the reply I
receive; ‘Rochefort, with its one street
and its one resident is bad enough in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
summer, but at this season it will be
unendurable.’ Yet I am not to be turned
from my purpose. I consider it is better
to be frozen outwardly than burned inwardly;
and that when one is flying from
a pestilence, there is no time to regret
the numerous pleasures left behind, or
the few that loom in the future. And
so we settle finally that, notwithstanding
its promised disadvantages, we will thankfully
accept the refuge Rochefort can
afford us; and having made up our
minds to go, we start twenty-four hours
afterwards.</p>

<p>Being pent-up in a railway carriage
with half-a-dozen manikins and womanikins,
who suck oranges half the time, and
obtrude their little persons between your
view and the window the other half, is
not perhaps the most favourable situation
from which to contemplate the beauties
of nature; for which reason, perhaps, it
is as well that for the first part of our
journey nature presents no beauties for
our contemplation, and thereby our naturally
mild tempers are prevented from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
boiling over. But when we have accomplished
about fifty miles (Rochefort
being distant from Brussels seventy miles)
the country begins to assume a different
and far more engaging aspect. The flat
table-land, much of it marshy and undrained,
which has scarcely been varied
hitherto, gives place to swelling hills, half
rock, half heather, and charming copses
of fir, some of which are very extensive.
The scenery becomes altogether more
wooded and naturally fertile-looking; and
houses and farmsteads lose all trace of
British contiguity, and become proportionately
interesting to curious English eyes.
The train is an express, and as it dashes
past the fragile, roughly-built little stations
with which the road is bordered, it is
amusing, or rather I should say it would
be amusing, did it not suggest the idea
of accidents, to see the signal-flags displayed
by peasant-women in every variety
of attitude and costume.</p>

<p>Here stands a stolid, solid Belgian girl,
of eighteen years of age probably, and
stout enough for forty, with a waist like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
a tar-barrel, and legs to match, who nurses
her flag as if it were a baby, and gazes
at the flying train with a countenance
which could not be more impassive were
it carved in wood. We have hardly
finished laughing at her, when the train
rushes past another station, at which appears
a withered old crone, her head tied
up in a coloured handkerchief, and her
petticoats, cut up to her knees, looking
cruelly short for such a wintry day, and
displaying a pair of attenuated legs and
feet for which the huge wooden <i>sabots</i>
look miles too large. She waves about
the signal-flag in a nervous, agitated
manner, which suggests the idea that she
is not quite sure whether she has caught
up the right one or not; but before we
have time to be made uncomfortable by
the fact, we are passing another of these
Belgic ‘shanties,’ at the door of which
appears for a moment a middle-aged
woman, who waves the signal at us in a
menacing manner, and rushes back immediately
to her children or her cooking.</p>

<p>Remembering our own signalmen, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the importance attached to their capabilities
and education for the important office
assigned them, it ceases to be a matter
of amusement to see the lives of hundreds
daily intrusted to the direction of such
ignorant creatures as these. I suppose
that ‘Monsieur,’ smoking at his ease by
the fireside in the little wooden station-house,
directs the actions of his mother,
wife, or daughter; but what are the
authorities about not to insist on his
performing his duty himself?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all which, however, our
train reaches Jemelle (the nearest station to
Rochefort) in safety, and in the midst of a
wind sufficient, if not to take our heads, to
take our hats off, we and our belongings
come to the ground. It takes some minutes
to get our nine packages together; and
when we present ourselves at the door of
the diligence, it is nearly full. I look
despairingly at the nurse and all the children,
and decide that the younger members
of the family must go by diligence, and the
elder shall walk with me to Rochefort. But
the Rochefortians are too polite to permit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
such a thing. Two of them insist upon
getting out and giving up their places to
the children. I protest against such a proceeding,
of course, as in duty bound, but
they will hear of no excuse, and start off
walking at such a pace that they are out of
sight before the diligence is set in motion.
At last the luggage is all packed away on
the top, and we are all packed away inside,
in company with two gentlemen, who open
the conversation pleasantly by asking us
where we come from, and telling us that
we must not expect to find Rochefort as
large as Brussels, which, to say truth, we
had scarcely anticipated. The talk becomes
fragmentary, for the diligence rattles
and jolts over the stony, hilly road, and the
bells on the horses’ collars jangle in unison;
and the baby is so enchanted with the noise,
that he shouts till no one can be heard but
himself. But twenty minutes’ purgatory
brings us into a long, steep, narrow street,
paved with stones, and bordered with grey-and-white
houses; and I have hardly time
to ask, ‘Is this Rochefort?’ when the
diligence draws up before a whitewashed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
house with a sign swinging before the door,
and I am asked if we are for the Hôtel Biron.
No, we are for the Hôtel de la Cloche d’Or;
and as no one seems to be for the Hôtel
Biron, the diligence continues to climb the
stony street until it reaches the summit, and
halts before the Hôtel de la Cloche d’Or.</p>

<p>Here we all unpack ourselves; and a
buxom German landlady, with a kind,
motherly face, comes down the steps to
greet us. She has received my letter; the
beds are all ready for us; the dinner will
be on the table in half-an-hour; we are to
be pleased to enter, and make ourselves at
home. We <i>are</i> very pleased; for we are
dreadfully tired (not cold, for the weather
is unnaturally mild), and have not had
anything substantial to eat all the day.
We climb up the steps of the hotel, which
looks just like a farmhouse abutting on the
main street, and find ourselves in a sanded
room, containing a long wooden table, with
benches either side of it, and bearing evident
reminiscences of smoking and drinking—in
fact, ‘not to put too fine a point on it,’
the public tap-room—but where we are met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
by the landlady’s two eldest daughters,
Thérèse and Josephine, who are beaming
in their welcome. They usher us into a
second room, where the children scream at
the sight of a table laid for dinner, and the
four corners of which bear bowls of whipped
cream and custard, and rosy Ardennes
apples, and biscuits just out of the oven.
The little people want to begin at once,
and cannot be brought to see the necessity
of washing their faces and hands first, or
waiting till the meat and potatoes shall be
placed upon the table. Would Madame
like to see the <i>chambres-à-coucher</i> at once?
Madame saying yes, Thérèse catches up
the youngest child but one, and, preceded
by Josephine, we enter first a scullery, next
a bricked passage, thence mount a most
perilous set of dark narrow stairs, and
stumble into a long whitewashed corridor,
which terminates in a glass-door opening
on to a garden. Here three doors successively
thrown open introduce us to our
bedrooms; and the trunks having been
brought up the breakneck stairs, we take
possession at once. The little white-curtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
beds are small, but beautifully clean,
and each one is surmounted by its eider-down
quilt in a coloured cotton case. Two
little islands of carpet in a sea of painted
boards represent the coverings of the floors;
and the washing-stands are only deal-tables,
and there are no chests of drawers; but we
inhale the fresh, vigorous breeze which is
pouring through the windows (open even
at that season), and think of fever-infected
Brussels, and are content. But though it
is all very nice and clean, we cannot possibly
wash without water, nor dry our
hands without towels.</p>

<p>An imbecile shout from the door for anybody
or anything brings a broad-featured,
rosy, grinning German girl to our aid, who,
when she is asked her name, says it is
Katrine, but we can call her by any name
we please. The pronunciation of ‘Katrine’
not presenting those difficulties to our
foreign tongues which the owner of it
seems to anticipate, we prefer to adhere
to her baptismal cognomen, instead of
naming her afresh, and desire Katrine to
bring us some hot water and towels; on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
which she disappears, still on the broad
grin, and returns with a pail of warm
water, which she sets down in the middle
of the room. We manage well enough
with that, however, but are at our wits’ end
when, on being asked for more of the same
fluid with which to mix the baby’s bottle,
she presents it to us in a washing-basin.
But as, a few minutes after, I encounter
her in the corridor carrying a coffee-pot
full to E—’s room, I conclude that in
Rochefort it is the fashion to use vessels
indiscriminately, and resolve thenceforth
to take the goods the gods provide, without
questioning.</p>

<p>On descending to the dining-room, we find
that the gods have been very munificent in
their gifts. After the soup appears roast
beef; and as we are very hungry, we cause
it to look foolish, and are just congratulating
each other on having made an excellent
dinner, when in trots Thérèse, pops our
dirty knives and forks upon the tablecloth,
whips away our plates, with that which
contains the remainder of the beef, and
puts down a dish of mutton-chops in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
stead. We look at one another in despair;
we feel it to be perfectly impossible to
begin again upon mutton-chops, and I am
obliged to hint the same to Thérèse in the
most delicate manner in the world. She
expostulates; but to no purpose, and leaves
the room, mutton-chops in hand. But
only to give place to her mother, who enters
with a countenance of dismay to inquire
what is wrong with the cooking that we
cannot eat.</p>

<p>Nothing is wrong; we have eaten remarkably
well. It is our capabilities of
stowage which are at fault. Will we not
have the hare, which is just ready to be
served up?</p>

<p>Sorry as we are to do it, we must decline
the hare; and as we affirm that we are
ready for the pudding, and nothing else, we
feel we have sunk in Madame’s estimation.</p>

<p>The pudding, a <i>compote</i> of apples and
preserves, with the whipped cream and
custard, is delicious; and as soon as we
have discussed it, we are very thankful to
stretch ourselves under the eider-down
quilts, and know the day to be over. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
have done work enough that day to entitle
us to twelve hours’ repose; yet we are all
wide-awake with the first beams of the
morning sun.</p>

<p>We dress ourselves with the pleasurable
anticipation of seeing new things, however
simple, and come downstairs to a breakfast-table,
in its way as plentifully spread as
the dinner-table of the night before. We
have an abundance of milk,—so fresh from
the cow that it is covered with froth, and
the jug which contains it is quite warm,—eggs,
cold meat, home-made bread in huge
brown loaves, good butter, and strong clear
coffee. In fact, we come to the conclusion
that our landlady knows how to live, and
we no longer marvel at the rosy cheeks and
full forms of Thérèse and Josephine, nor
that Madame herself fills out her dresses in
such a magnificent manner.</p>

<p>E— has been for a stroll before breakfast,
and brings back a report of ruins on
the high ground; he has already unpacked
his sketch-books and sharpened his pencils.
We, not being walking encyclopædias,
seize our <i>Continental Bradshaw</i>, and find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
that the ruins are those of a castle in which
Lafayette was made prisoner by the Austrians
in 1792.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast is concluded, we
rush off to see the ruined castle, which
stands on an eminence just above the hotel,
and which our landlady (who walks into our
sitting-room and takes a chair in the most
confiding manner possible whenever she
feels so inclined) informs us, although not
open to the public, belongs to a lady whose
house is built on the same ground, and who
will doubtless allow us to look over it.
We can see the remains of the castle before
we reach them, and decide that it must
have been uglier and less interesting when
whole than now, having been evidently
designed with a view to strength rather
than beauty. The little winding acclivitous
path which leads to it, bounded by a
low wall fringed with ferns and mosses, is
perhaps the prettiest part of the whole concern;
but just as we have scaled it, and come
upon the private dwelling-house, our poetic
meditations are interrupted by the onslaught
of half-a-dozen dogs (one of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
is loose, and makes fierce snaps at our unprotected
legs), which rush out of their
kennels at chains’ length, and bark so
vociferously, that we feel we have no need
to make our presence known by knocking
at the door. A child appears at it; and
we inquire politely if we may see the
ruins, at which she shakes her head, and
we imagine she doesn’t understand our
Parisian French.</p>

<p>But in another moment we are undeceived,
for the shrill, vixenish voice of a
woman (may dogs dance upon her grave!)
exclaims sharply from the open door,
‘<i>Fermez, fermez; on ne peut pas entrer.</i>’
The child obediently claps it to in our faces,
and we retrace our steps, with a conviction
that the lady is like her castle—more strong
than beautiful. E— is so disgusted that
he will not even sketch the ruins from the
opposite side of the road, up which another
precipitous path leads us to a long walk,
which in summer must be a perfect bower,
from the interlacing of the branches of the
trees with which it is bordered; and from
which we have a far better view of the ruins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
than the utmost politeness of their owner
could have afforded us. But no; judgment
has gone out against them; we decide they
are heavy and unpicturesque, and not worth
the trouble; and we walk on in hopes of
finding something better: and are rewarded.
At the close of the long over-shadowed
walk, a quaint little chapel, beside which
stands a painted wooden crucifix nearly the
size of life, excites our curiosity, and, walking
round it, we come upon one of the
loveliest scenes, even in the month of
February, that Nature ever produced.</p>

<p>A green valley, creeping in sinuous folds
between two ranges of high hills; one
rocky and coated with heather, the other
clothed with wood. Beneath the rocky
range there winds a road bordered by trees,—along
which we can see the red diligence
which brought us from the station taking
its jangling way,—and beside it runs a
stream, terminating in a cascade and a
bridge, and the commencement of the
lower part of Rochefort. All the fields are
cut upon the sides of hills, and are diversified
by clumps of rock covered with ferns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
and usually the groundwork of a well, protected
by a few rough planks, or the
fountain-head of a mountain-stream which
trickles down until it joins the river. This
is the valley of Jemelle, to see which in the
proper season would alone be worth a
journey to Rochefort. We look and
admire, and lament the impossibility of
ever transferring such a scene to canvas as
it should be done; and then we turn back
whence we came, and find we are standing
at the entrance of an artificial cave, situated
at the back of the crucifix before alluded
to, and which forms perhaps as great a
contrast to the natural loveliness we have
just looked upon, as could well be. Apparently
it is the tomb of some woman, by
the framed requests which hang on either
side that prayers may be offered for the repose
of her soul; but had her friends turned
out upon her grave all the maimed and
motley rubbish to be found in a nursery
playbox of some years’ standing, they could
scarcely have decorated it in a less seemly
manner. At the end of the cave is a
wooden grating, behind which is exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
one of those tawdry assemblages of horrors
which tend more perhaps than all else to
bring ridicule on the Roman Catholic
religion, so utterly opposed are they to our
conceived ideas of what is sacred. Two or
three rudely-carved and coarsely-painted,
almost grotesque, wooden groups of the
dead Christ, the Holy Family, and the
Crucifixion, form the groundwork of this
exhibition: the interstices being filled up
with gold-and-white jars of dirty artificial
flowers; framed prints of saints with lace
borders, reminding one of the worst description
of valentines; and composite
figures, supposed to represent the same
individuals, and which may have cost fifty
centimes apiece. The collection is such as
to make the spectator shudder to see holy
things so unholily treated; and it is difficult
to conceive how, in this century, when art
has been carried to such a pitch that even
our commonest jugs and basons have
assumed forms consistent with it, anyone,
even the lowest, can be satisfied with such
designs and colouring as these things
display.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Returning homeward by the lower part
of the town, we pass a <i>maison religieuse</i>
dedicated to St Joseph, and in the garden
see the good little sisters joining their
pupils, to the number of forty or fifty, in a
merry game of ‘Here we go round the
mulberry-bush,’ and apparently taking as
much pleasure in the exercise as the
youngest there. The church and churchyard
stand at this end of Rochefort. There
is nothing in the building to attract one’s
notice, except that we agree that it is the
ugliest we have ever seen; but we walk
round the little churchyard, the paucity of
graves in which speaks well for the climate
of the place. The crosses and railings,
made of the commonest wood and in the
most fragile manner, are all rotting as they
stand or lie (several having assumed the
recumbent position); and we are leaving
the spot with the conviction that we have
wasted five minutes, when we come against
a crucifix fastened by heavy iron clamps
against the wall of the church. A common
iron cross, rusty and red from damp and
age, with a figure nailed on it of the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
perfect bronze, old and hard, and dark and
bright, and as unchanged by weather and
exposure as on the day (perhaps hundreds
of years ago) it was first placed there.</p>

<p>Toiling up the street again, and examining
the shops as we go, I say that, much
as I like Rochefort, I do not advise any
one to come here in order to purchase their
wedding <i>trousseau</i>, or lay in a stock of
winter clothing. We look in vain for
something to buy in remembrance of the
place; but can see nothing out of the way,
except it is a yellow teapot, holding at the
least four quarts, and with a curled spout
to prevent the tea coming out too fast,
which must be almost necessary with such
a load of liquid. The teapot is delicious,
and quite unique; but scarcely worth, we
think, the trouble of transportation. We
have but just decided this matter to our
satisfaction when we come upon a ‘miscellaneous
warehouse,’ upon whose front is
painted ‘<i>Cartes pour les grottes de Rochefort</i>,’
and remember that we must see the
famous grotto, and turn in to ask the price
of admission. Five francs a-head; children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
half-price. We think the charge is high;
but Monsieur C— (to whom the grotto
belongs) takes us into his house and shows
us prints of the different views of its
interior, which fire our imagination to that
degree, that we decide at once to see it the
next morning. We look over a book also
in which visitors to the grotto have written
down their first impressions; and these
testimonials excite our curiosity still further.
A Persian describes himself as having
been suddenly transported into fairyland;
and can liken the vast caverns to nothing
but the palace of his great master the
Sultan, and the various forms assumed by
the stalactites to those of lovely houris
grouped about him. A French poet, in
rapturous verse, compares the grotto to
the enchanted halls of the Arabian Nights,
and the stalactites to ‘frozen tears.’ Every
traveller declares the sight to have been
more wonderful and beautiful than anything
he has ever seen before, until we become
quite sorry to think we must put off seeing
it until the morning; and our expectations
are heightened by the rapid assurance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Monsieur C— (who always keeps his
hands moving, and never stops to consider
his commas), that it is ‘<i>trèsbeautrèsbeautrèsbeau</i>!’
However, we agree to return
the next day at eleven o’clock, when he
promises the guides shall be in readiness
for us; and we go home to another excellent
dinner, the pleasure of which is only
marred by the fact that Thérèse <i>will</i> make
us use the same knives and forks for every
course; and we haven’t the strength of
mind to resist.</p>

<p>Yesterday I spoke to madame on the
necessity of engaging someone during the
mornings to read French and German with
the girls, as we shall most likely be here
for a month; and it is too long a time for
them to be idle. Madame did not think I
should find a <i>demoiselle</i> in Rochefort who
could instruct them; but there is a <i>professeur</i>
here who has passed all his college
examinations, and who, if he has the time,
will doubtless be very glad of the employment.
I asked her to send for the <i>professeur</i>
that I might speak to him on the
subject; and here, just as we have done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
dinner, he arrives; for madame throws
open the door, and with a certain pride in
her voice (pride that Rochefort should
possess such an article), announces ‘<i>Monsieur
le Professeur</i>.’ I glance up, thinking
of Charlotte Brontë and her professor, and
hoping this one may not prove as dirty
and seedy and snuffy, and, to my amazement,
see standing on the threshold a lad
of about seventeen or eighteen, dressed in
green trousers and a blue blouse, and holding
his cap in his hand. The two girls
immediately choke, and bury their faces in
their books, which renders my task of
catechising rather a difficult one; and I
glance at E— for aid, but his countenance
is almost level with the table as he
pretends to draw. So I find there is
nothing to be done but to beg the <i>professeur</i>
to be seated,—a request which he
steadily refuses to comply with; and as he
stands there, twisting his cap in his hands,
he looks so like a butcher-boy, that it is a
mercy I do not ask him what meat he has
to-day.</p>

<p>But the poor young man is so horribly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
nervous, as he tells me that, though qualified
for a tutor, he has never taught before,
that I have not the heart to refuse him on
account of his youth; besides, is he not the
sole <i>professeur</i> in Rochefort? So I give
him leave to come the next morning, and
try, at all events, what he can do with the
girls; and he looks very happy for the
permission. And we see him a minute
afterwards, striding proudly down the street,
whistling as he goes, and holding his
head half an inch higher for having
‘got a situation.’ Of course the children
make merry over him for the rest of the
evening, and cannot recall the appearance
of their <i>professeur</i> without shrieks of laughter;
but he comes the next morning, nevertheless,
to commence his duties, and proves
to be quite as particular as older teachers,
and much more competent than some, and
takes the youngest girl completely aback
by telling her she shall be punished if she
is not steady.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the next morning we
are all ready to view the grottoes, and
E— and I, with the two eldest children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
start off on our expedition. The way to
their entrance lies through Monsieur C—’s
park, which in summer must be a very
charming resort. He has collected here
all the wild animals indigenous to the
Ardennes, and shows them to us as we
walk to the mouth of the grottoes. Close
to his house he has a splendid wolf and
three foxes—the golden, silver, and common
fox. I should have preferred to keep
these interesting specimens a little further
off from my own nose; but there is no
accounting for tastes. In the aviary he
has squirrels, guinea-pigs, doves, pigeons,
and the most magnificent pair of horned
owls I have ever seen. These birds, which
are as fierce as possible, have eyes of jet
and amber, as big as half-crowns, and when
in their rage they spring at passers-by,
they make a noise with their beaks just
like castanets.</p>

<p>A little farther up the park we come
upon the Ardennes deer, which are thicker
built and less graceful than the English
fallow-deer, with which they are consorting;
and a wild boar, with fierce tusks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
a savage grunt, wallowing in a <i>parterre</i> of
clay, which, nevertheless, knows his master,
and puts his ugly snout out to be scratched
between the palisades of his domain.
Monsieur C— only conducts us as far as
the entrance of the grotto, and there
delivers us over to the care of the guides,
two in number, who each carry a couple
of petroleum lamps, and have ‘Grottes de
Rochefort’ written on their hatbands.
They ask us if we will have costumes to
enter the caves with, and we decline, not
knowing the dirt we shall encounter; but
we exchange our own hats for little, grey
linen ones, trimmed with a cockade and
bunch of small red feathers in front, made
after the pattern of those adopted by the
monkeys on the organs, and in which we
appear very comical to each other’s eyes.
Everything is ready, and down we go—down
the first flight of steps, which is steep
but easy, and which, Monsieur C— shouts
after us, will be the most difficult descent
of all (I wonder if he impresses that fable
on all his visitors) until the ivy and fern-covered
entrance is passed, and we enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
the very mouth of the cave, which is yet
light enough to let us see that several
such flights have still to be descended.
We have hardly reached the middle of the
second, and daylight is not yet left behind
us, when E— calls out that he cannot
breathe, and must go up into the fresh air
again. The guides insist that monsieur
must be mistaken, and no one is ever
taken ill there. I insist, on the other hand,
that monsieur’s wishes must be complied
with, and we must reaccompany him to the
top, which we do. I would rather not go
back again then, and make the dark pilgrimage
alone with the children, but E— begs we
will, and the girls look disappointed; so we
retrace our steps, leaving him in the park.</p>

<p>I confess that as I go down the second
time I feel a little nervous, and my limbs
shake. I don’t like this going down, down,
down into the shades of eternal night, with
no companions but two little children.</p>

<p>But at last we stand on level ground
again. There is no light anywhere except
from the guides’ lamps, the foremost one
(who is always spokesman) waves his above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
his head, and introduces <i>la grande salle</i>.
I look up and around me, but all is black
as pitch. I feel that I am standing on
broken flints and a great deal of mud; and
as the guide’s lamp throws its faint gleam
here and there, I see that the cavern we
stand in is very vast and damp, and uncommonly
like a huge cellar; but I can’t say
I see anything more. In another minute
the guide has turned, and leads us through
a passage cut in the rock. We are not
going up or downstairs now, but picking
our way over slippery stones and between
places sometimes so narrow and sometimes
so low, that our shoulders get various
bumps and bruises, and the guide’s warning
of ‘<i>Garde tête!</i>’ sounds continuously.
Every now and then we come upon a
larger excavation, which is called a <i>salle</i>,
and given some name consequent on the
likeness assumed by the stalactites contained
in it. Thus one is called <i>salle de
Brahma</i>, because it contains a large stalactite,
somewhat resembling the idol of that
name. Another <i>salle du sacrifice</i>, because
its principal attraction is a large flat stone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
at the foot of which is another, shaped
sausage-wise, and entitled <i>tombeau de la
victime</i>. We pace after the guides through
these cavernous passages for what appears
to me miles, my mind meanwhile being
divided between fear that I should leave
my boots behind me in the slushy clay, or
that either of my children should tumble
down or knock her head. Every cavern
is like the other, and I look in vain for
stalactites which shall remind me of ‘houris
grouped about the sultan,’ or ‘frozen tears.’
The guides occasionally produce a fine
effect by burning a little red fire, or letting-off
a rocket, or climbing singly up the
more perilous places, that we may watch
the gradual ascent of their flickering lamps,
and judge of the height of the larger <i>salles</i>.
But I suppose the enthusiastic scribblers
in the visitors’ book would consider me the
possessor of a very darkened intellect if
they heard me affirm that I have seen
better effects on the stage, and climbed
greater heights with much more convenience.
Perhaps I have not a sufficiently
appreciative soul for grottoes; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
greater part of the grotto of Rochefort
comes up exactly to my idea of a mine, and
nothing more.</p>

<p>The ‘glittering’ stalactites are nowhere.
The cave is lined with stalactites, but (with
the exception of a few white ones) they are
all of a uniform pale-brown colour, and
have no idea of glittering or being prismatic.
The greatest wonder of the grotto
is its vastness, which may be estimated
from the fact that we are two hours going
over it, and then have not traversed the
whole on account of fresh works being carried
on in parts. We penetrate to its very
depths to see the river and the waterfall,
but the mud is so excessive that we are
compelled to stop, and let the guide descend
with his lamp and flash it over the water,
which is really very pretty, and, strange to
relate, contains good trout.</p>

<p>Then we plough our way upwards again;
up fungus-covered ladders, and wet, slippery
stairs, upon which it is most difficult
to keep a footing, until we arrive at decidedly
the finest sight there—the <i>salle du
sabbat</i>. Here the guides send up a spirit-balloon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
to show us the height and extent
of the vast cavern, and we are rather awe-struck,
particularly as, in order that we
may see the full effect, the other guide
plants us on three chairs and takes away
both the lamps, leaving us seated in the
darkness, on the edge of a precipice. The
blackness is so thick about us that we can
almost <i>feel</i> it; and the silence is that of
death. My youngest girl slips her little
hand in mine, and whispers, ‘Mamma, supposing
he weren’t to come back again!’
and I can’t say the prospect pleases. However,
the balloon reaches the top of the
cavern, and is hauled back again; and the
guide <i>does</i> come back; and, whilst he is
assisting his fellow to pack it away, I sing
a verse of ‘God save the Queen,’ for the
children to hear the echo, which is stupendous.</p>

<p>Then we see the prettiest thing, perhaps,
we have seen yet. At the top of the
<i>salle du sabbat</i> there is a kind of breakage
in the side, and a large cluster of stalactites.
One guide climbs up to this place
and holds his lamp behind the group,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
whilst the other calls out ‘<i>la femme qui
repose</i>;’ when lo! before us there appears
almost an exact representation of a woman,
reclining with crossed legs, and a child on
her bosom. It is so good an imitation,
that it might be a figure carved in stone
and placed there, and I think the sight
gave us more pleasure than anything in the
grotto. We have come upon several
groups of stalactites already, to which the
guides have given names, such as <i>l’ange
de la résurrection</i>, <i>l’oreille de l’éléphant</i>, and
<i>le lion Belge</i>; but though they have, of
course, borne some resemblance to the
figures mentioned, the likeness is only admitted
for want of a better. This likeness,
however, is excellent, could hardly be more
like; and we are proportionately pleased.
With the <i>salle du sabbat</i> and the balloon
the exhibition is ended; and we are thankful
to emerge into the fresh air again, and
to leave slippery staircases and the smell
of fungi behind us.</p>

<p>We feel very heated when we stand on
the breezy hill again, for the grotto, contrary
to our expectation, has proved exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
warm, and the exercise has made
us feel more so; and daylight looks so
strange that we can scarcely persuade ourselves
we have not been passing the night
down below. We have picked up several
little loose bits of stone and stalactite during
our progress, and when we reach home,
we spread them out before us on the table,
and try to remember where they came
from. Here is a bit of marble, veined
black-and-white; and here is white stone,
glistening and silvery. Here is the stalactite,
a veritable piece of ‘frozen tears’ and
<i>couchant houris</i>.</p>

<p>Well, we have been a little disappointed
with the grottoes of Rochefort, perhaps;
we have not found the crystallisations quite
so purple-and-amber as we anticipated, or
the foundations quite so clean; but, after
all, it is what we must expect in this life.
If the grotto is not so brilliant as we expected,
it is at least a very wonderful and
uncommon sight; and so in this life, if we
can but forget the purple-and-gold, we
may extract a great deal of amusement
from very small things, if we choose to try.
With which bit of philosophy I conclude.</p>

of course) with his fifth section,
‘The Origin of Dreams.’ Jones is full of
fire and imagination, but he does not care
for plodding, and he knew me of old for
a good steady compiler. I agreed with
alacrity. ‘The Origin of Dreams’ would
fill those hungry little mouths of mine for
three months at the very least. But how
to do it whilst they gaped around me!—how
to cover the one table in my solitary
sitting-room with valuable works of reference
at the risk of their being touched by greasy
fingers!—how to wade through volume
after volume, placing a mental mark there
and a material one here, whilst my offspring
either surreptitiously removed the one or
irretrievably obliterated remembrance of
the other, by attracting my attention to
the manner in which they attempted to
scalp each other’s heads or gouge out each
other’s eyes! I tried it for a week in
vain.</p>

<p>My Press work I had been accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
to do at office, but this, which was to be
based upon the contents of certain ponderous
black-lettered tomes which Jones had
been collecting for ages past, must be
carried on at home, and the noisy, wearisome
day gave me no time for reflection,
and left me without energy to labour at
night. I was about to resign the task in
despair—to tell Jones to give it to some
more capable or more fortunate labourer
in the wide field of speculation—when
Fate came to my rescue in the person
of the Hon. Captain Rivers, Lord Seaborne’s
son.</p>

<p>‘My dad’s in an awful way about his
ward, young Cockleboat,’ he remarked to
me, in his friendly manner, ‘and he wants
your assistance, Trueman, if you’ll give
it him.’</p>

<p>‘Why, what’s the matter, Captain
Rivers?’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you heard? Cockleboat’s
made a fool of himself. He fell in love
with a nursemaid, or a barmaid, or some
such sort of person—he, with his twenty
thousand a-year in prospect; and when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the governor remonstrated with him—told
him ’twas nonsense and couldn’t be, and
all that sort of thing, he actually ran
away!’</p>

<p>‘Left Lord Seaborne’s house?’</p>

<p>‘Of course, and without a word of explanation.
Now, dad doesn’t want to make
the affair public, you know, unless it becomes
necessary, so he hasn’t said a word
to the police; but he wants you to find
out where Cockleboat is—you’re so clever
at that sort of thing—and just bring him
home again.’</p>

<p>‘An easy task, certainly. And you don’t
even know which way the lad has gone?’</p>

<p>‘Well, we think we’ve traced him to
Norwich, and dad thought if you wouldn’t
mind going up there for a bit, and keeping
your eyes open; of course we should make
it worth your while, you know, you
might hear something of the young scamp
for us.’</p>

<p>‘What on earth can be his motive for
leaving home?’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps the lady lives up that
way, or Julian may have got it into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
head that he’ll work to support her. He
is but twenty last birthday, and will not
be of age, by his father’s will, for the next
five years—very lucky for him, as it’s
turned out, that he will not be.’</p>

<p>‘True. I think I remember seeing the
lad at Lady Godiva’s last season. Didn’t
he act there in some private theatricals or
charades?’</p>

<p>‘I believe he did. Now, Trueman,
what’s your decision? Will you go to
Norwich for us or not?’</p>

<p>‘I will start to-morrow if your father
wishes it.’</p>

<p>The offer had come most opportunely;
even as Captain Rivers was speaking it
had flashed through my mind that here
was the very opportunity that I desired
to carry out my project of writing the
fifth section of Jones’ Cyclopædia;—a
remote lodging in one of the back streets
of the quiet old city of Norwich, whence
I could carry on my inquiries all day, and
where I might sit up and write out my
notes all night. And Lord Seaborne’s
generosity in such cases was too well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
known to permit of any doubt on the
subject whether I should not (by accepting
his proposal) be killing two birds with one
stone. So I did accept it, with gratitude,
and having obtained all the information
possible respecting the mysterious disappearance
of Master Julian Cockleboat,
I packed up the black-lettered tomes, and,
embracing my smiling wife and children,
who appeared rather pleased than otherwise
at the prospect of getting rid of me
for a few weeks, started for Norwich.</p>

<p>I have a great respect for old county
towns: there is a dignified sobriety and
sense of unimpeachable respectability about
them that impresses me. I like their old-world
institutions and buildings—their
butter crosses and market steps; their
dingy bye streets with kerbstones for
pavements; their portentous churches and
beadles; their old-fashioned shops and
goods and shopmen. I like the quiet
that reigns in their streets, the paucity
of gas they light them up with, the strange
conveyances their citizens ply for hire—in
fact, I like everything with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
world in general finds fault. So it was
with a sense of pleasure I found myself
wandering about the streets of Norwich,
on the look-out for some place in which
to lay my head. I had rather have been
there than at the seaside, although it was
bright July weather, and I knew the waves
were frothing and creaming over the golden
sands beneath a canopy of cloudless blue
sky. I preferred the shaded, cloister-like
streets of the county town, with its cool
flags under my feet, and its unbroken sense
of calm.</p>

<p>I did not turn into the principal thoroughfares,
with their gay shops and gayer
passengers, but down the less-frequented
bye-ways, where children playing in the
road stopped open-mouthed to watch me
pass, and women’s heads appeared above
the window-blinds, as my footfall sounded
on the narrow pavement, as though a
stranger were something to be stared at.
Many windows held the announcement of
‘Rooms to Let,’ but they were too small—too
modern, shall I say—too fresh-looking
to take my fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>I connected space and gloom with solitude
and reflection, and felt as if I could
not have sat down before a muslin-draped
window, filled with scarlet geraniums and
yellow canariensis, to ponder upon ‘The
Origin of Dreams,’ to save my life. At
last I came upon what I wanted. Down a
narrow street, into which the sun seemed
never to have penetrated, I found some
tall, irregular, dingy-looking buildings—most
of which appeared to be occupied as
insurance, wine, or law offices,—and in the
lower window of one there hung a card
with the inscription, ‘Apartments for a
Single Gentleman.’</p>

<p>It was just the place from which to
watch and wait—in which to ponder, and
compare, and compose,—and I ascended
its broken steps, convinced that the birthplace
of ‘The Origin of Dreams’ was
found. A middle-aged woman, with an
intelligent, pleasing face answered my
summons to the door. The weekly rent
she asked for the occupation of the vacant
apartments sounded to me absurdly low,
but perhaps that was due to my experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
of the exorbitant demands of London landladies.
But when I explained to her the
reason for which I desired her rooms,
namely, that I might sit up at night and
write undisturbed, her countenance visibly
fell.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid they won’t suit you, then, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Why not? Have you any objection
to my studying by night?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, sir. You could do as you
pleased about that!’</p>

<p>‘What then? Will your other lodgers
disturb me?’</p>

<p>Her face twitched as she answered, ‘I
have no other lodgers, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Do you live in this big house, then, by
yourself?’</p>

<p>‘My husband and I have been in charge
of it for years, and are permitted to occupy
the lower floor in consideration of keeping
the upper rooms (which are only used as
offices in the day-time) clean and in order.
But the clerks are all gone by five o’clock,
so they wouldn’t interfere with your night-work.’</p>

<p>‘What will, then?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>‘I’m afraid there are a good many rats
about the place, sir. They <i>will</i> breed in
these old houses, and keep up a racket at
night.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t mind the rats,’ I answered,
cheerfully. ‘I’ll catch as many as I can
for you, and frighten away the others. If
that is your only objection, the rooms are
mine. May I see them?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, sir,’ she said, as she closed
the door behind me and led the way into
two lofty and spacious chambers, connected
by folding-doors, which had once
formed the dining-saloon of a splendid
mansion.</p>

<p>‘The owners of the house permit us
to occupy this floor and the basement,
and as it’s more than we require, we let
these rooms to lodgers. They’re not very
grandly furnished, sir, but it’s all neat and
clean.’</p>

<p>She threw open the shutters of the
further apartment as she spoke, and the
July sun streamed into the empty room.
As its rays fell upon the unmade bed,
my eye followed them and caught sight of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
a deep indentation in the mattress. The
landlady saw it also, and looked amazed.</p>

<p>‘Some one has been taking a siesta
here without your permission,’ I said,
jestingly; but she did not seem to take
my remark as a jest.</p>

<p>‘It must be my good man,’ she answered,
hurriedly, as she shook the mattress;
‘perhaps he came in here to lie
down for a bit. This hot weather makes
the best feel weak, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Very true. And now, if you will
accept me as a lodger, I will pay you
my first week’s rent, and whilst I go back
to the railway-station to fetch my valise,
you must get me ready a chop or a
steak, or anything that is most handy,
for my dinner.’</p>

<p>All appeared to be satisfactory. My
landlady assented to everything I suggested,
and in another hour I was comfortably
ensconced under her roof, had
eaten my steak, and posted a letter to my
wife, and felt very much in charity with
all mankind. So I sat at the open window
thinking how beautifully still and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
sweet all my surroundings were, and how
much good work I should get through
without fear of interruption or distraction.
The office clerks had long gone home;
the upper rooms were locked for the night;
only an occasional patter along the wide
uncarpeted staircase reminded me that I
was not quite alone. Then I remembered
the rats, and ‘The Origin of Dreams;’
and thinking it probable that my honest
old couple retired to bed early, rang
the bell to tell my landlady to be sure and
leave me a good supply of candles.</p>

<p>‘You’re not going to sit up and write
to-night, sir, are you?’ she inquired.
‘I am sure your rest would do you more
good; you must be real tired.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, my good Mrs Bizzey’
(Did I say her name was Bizzey?), ‘I am
as fresh as a daisy, and could not close
my eyes. Besides, as your friends, the
rats, seem to make so free in the house, I
should burn a light any way to warn
them they had better not come too near
me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I trust nothing will disturb you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
sir,’ she said, earnestly, as she withdrew
to fetch the candles.</p>

<p>I unpacked my book-box and piled the
big volumes on a side table. How imposing
they looked! But I had no intention
of poring over them that night.
‘The Origin of Dreams’ required thought—deep
and speculative thought; and how
could I be better circumstanced to indulge
in it than stationed at that open window,
with a pipe in my mouth, looking up
at the dark blue sky bespangled with
stars, and listening (if I may be allowed
to speak so paradoxically) to the silence—for
there is a silence that can be heard?</p>

<p>When Mrs Bizzey brought me the
candles, she asked me if I required
anything else, as she and Mr Bizzey
were about to retire to the marital couch,
which I afterwards ascertained was erected
in the scullery. I answered in the negative,
and wished her good-night, hearing
her afterwards distinctly close the door
at the head of the kitchen stairs and
descend step by step to the arms of her
lord and master. But Mrs Bizzey’s intrusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
had murdered my reverie. I could
not take up the chain of thought where
she had severed the links. The night
air, too, seemed to have grown suddenly
damp and chilly, and I pulled down the
window sash with a jerk, and taking out
my note-book and writing-case drew a
chair up to the table and commenced to
think, playing idly with my pen the while.
Soon the divine afflatus (the symptoms
of which every successful writer knows
so well) came down upon me. I ceased to
think—or rather to be aware that I was
thinking. My pen ran over the paper
as though some other hand guided it than
my own, and I wrote rapidly, filling page
after page with a stream of ideas that
seemed to pour out of my brain involuntarily.
Time is of no account under such
circumstances, and I may have been
scribbling for one hour or for three, for
aught I knew to the contrary, before
I was roused to a sense of my position
by hearing a footfall sound through the
silent, deserted house.</p>

<p>Now, although I have described my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
condition to be such as to render me impervious
to outer impressions, I am certain
of one thing—that no noise, however
slight, had hitherto broken in upon it.
It was the complete absence of sound
that had permitted my spirit to have full
play irrespective of my body; and directly
the silence was outraged, my physical
life re-asserted its claims, and my senses
became all alive to ascertain the cause
of it. In another moment the sound was
repeated, and I discovered that it was
over my head—not under my feet. It
could not, then, proceed from either of
the old couple, whom I had heard lock
themselves up together down below. Who
could it be?</p>

<p>My first idea, emanating from my landlady’s
information that the noise might
proceed from rats, I had already dismissed
with contempt. It was the reverberation
of a footstep. There could be
no doubt about that; and my next thought
naturally flew to burglars, who were making
an attempt on the safes in the offices
above. What could I do? I was utterly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
unarmed, and to go in pursuit of midnight
robbers in so defenceless a condition
would be simply delivering myself into
their power. I certainly might have shied
a couple of Jones’ black-lettered books at
their heads, for they were ponderous
enough to knock any man down, but I
might not take a steady aim, and it is
better not to attempt at all than to
attempt and fail.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sounds overhead had
increased in number and become continuous,
as though some one had commenced
to walk up and down the room.
Surely no midnight thief would dare to
create so much disturbance as that! Detection
of his crime would be inevitable.
Or did he trust to the sound sleep of the
porter and his wife in the kitchen below,
not knowing that I, existent and wakeful,
intervened between himself and them?
In another minute I believe that I should
have cast all consequences to the winds,
and rushed, not <i>in</i>, but <i>up</i> to the rescue,
forgetting I was a husband and a father,
and armed with Jones’ patent self-acting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
leveller, alone have ascended to the upper
story to investigate the cause of the midnight
disturbance I heard. Only—<i>I
didn’t!</i> For before I had had time to
shoulder my weapons and screw my courage
up to the sticking-point, another sound
reached my ears that made the patent
levellers drop on the table again with
a thump,—the sound, not of a step, but
a groan—a deep, hollow, unmistakable
groan, that chilled the marrow in my bones
to such a degree that it would have been a
disgrace to any cook to send them up to
table.</p>

<p>I knew then that I must have been mistaken
in my first theory, and that the
sounds I overheard, whether they proceeded
from mortals or not, had no connection
with the nefarious occupation of
housebreakers. But they had become a
thousand times more interesting, and I
listened attentively.</p>

<p>The groan was followed by some muttered
words that sounded like a curse,
succeeded by louder tones of reproach or
anger. Then the footsteps traversed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
floor again, and seemed to be chasing
someone or something round and round
the room. At last I heard another groan,
followed by a heavy fall.</p>

<p>I started to my feet. Surely Mr and
Mrs Bizzey must have been roused by such
an unusual commotion, and would come
upstairs to learn the reason! But no!—they
did not stir. All was silent as the
grave below, and above also. The noises
had suddenly ceased. I appeared to be
alone in the empty house. It was all so
strange that I put my hands up to my
head and asked myself if I were properly
awake. I was hardly satisfied on this
point before the sounds recommenced
overhead, and precisely in the same order
as before. Again I listened to the pacing
feet—the groan—the curse—the chase—the
fall! Each phase of the ghostly
tragedy—for such I now felt sure it must
be—was repeated in rotation, not once,
but a couple of dozen or more times; and
then at last the disturbance ceased as suddenly
and as unexpectedly as it had
commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>I looked at my watch. It was three
o’clock, and already the early birds on the
look-out for the worm had begun to herald
the dawn with a few faint twitters in the
trees in the cloister. I threw off my
clothes impatiently, and lying down in my
bed, gave myself up, not to sleep, but
reflection on what was best to be done. I
had not the slightest doubt left as to the
cause of the noises I had heard. My
landlady might ascribe them to rats, but
were she closely questioned she would
probably acknowledge the truth—that she
knew the sounds to proceed from spirits,
popularly called ghosts; which accounted
for all her hesitation and change of countenance
when speaking to me about the
apartments, also for the low price she
asked for her rooms, and her evident wish
to dissuade me from sitting up at night.</p>

<p>Naturally the poor woman was afraid
she should never secure a lodger if the
truth were known; but as far as I was
concerned, she was altogether mistaken—I
was not afraid of her ghosts. On the
contrary, as I lay in bed and thought on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
what had just occurred, I congratulated
myself that, by a third strange coincidence,
my visit to Norwich promised to turn out
all that I could desire.</p>

<p>I must ‘lay’ these ghosts, of course—i.e.,
if they interfered with my graver work;
but to have the opportunity of doing so
was the very thing my heart was set upon.
Is my reader surprised to hear this?
Then I must take him further into my
confidence.</p>

<p>When I confessed I was an author,
Press writer, amateur detective, and father
of six children, I did not add the crowning
iniquity, and write myself down a believer
in ghosts and spiritualism. Every man
acknowledges himself a spirit, and to have
been created by the power of a spirit. Most
men believe that spirits have the capability
of free volition and locomotion, and many
that they have exercised these powers by
re-appearing to their fellow spirits in the
flesh. But to assert publicly that you believe
in all this because you have proved it
to be the truth, is to throw yourself open
to the charge of being a dupe, or a madman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
or a liar. Therefore I had preferred
until then to keep my faith a secret. My
children’s bread depended in a great
measure on the reputation I kept up as
a man of sense, and I had not dared to
risk it by attempting to put my theories
into practice. Not that I was entirely
ignorant of the rules pertaining to the
science of spiritualism. Under cover of
the darkness that hides all delinquencies,
I had attended several circles gathered for
the sole purpose of investigating the mysteries
of other worlds; but it had always
been accomplished with the utmost secrecy,
as my wife was hysterically disposed, and
the mere mention of a spirit would have
upset the house for days together.</p>

<p>I had never, therefore, had the opportunity
of pursuing spiritualism on my own
account; and until the day broke I lay
awake, congratulating myself on the good
luck that had thrown me, cheek by jowl,
with a party of ready-made ghosts, whom
a very little encouragement would, I
trusted, induce to pay me a visit in my
own apartments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>All the next day I wandered through
the streets of Norwich and in the country
surrounding them, speculating—not on the
whereabouts of Julian Cockleboat, nor
‘The Origin of Dreams’—but how I
should persuade my landlady to help me
unravel the mysterious occurrence of the
night before. At last I bethought me
that ‘honesty is the best policy’ after all,
and decided that I would make a clean
breast of my suspicions and desires. If
Mrs Bizzey were a sensible woman, she
would prove only too ready to aid me in
ridding her apartments of visitors that
must injure their reputation; and, at
all events, I could but try her. So I
opened the subject on the very first
opportunity. The woman was clearing
away my tea-things the same evening,
when she remarked that I had not eaten
well.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you sit up too much at
night, sir, to make a good appetite.’</p>

<p>‘Other people seem to sit up in this
house at night as well as myself, Mrs
Bizzey,’ I replied, significantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ she said,
colouring.</p>

<p>‘Why, do you mean to say you never
hear noises;—that you were not disturbed
last night, for instance, by the sound of
groans and voices, and of some one falling
about in the upper rooms?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, you don’t mean to tell me as
you’ve heard them already!’ exclaimed
Mrs Bizzey, clasping her hands and letting
a teacup fall in her agitation. ‘If you go
too, you’ll be the third gentleman that has
left within a fortnight on that account;
and if a stop ain’t put to it, the house will
get such a name that nobody will put a
foot inside the door for love or money.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t mean to go, Mrs Bizzey;
on the contrary, I should be very sorry to
go; and if you and your husband will consent
to help me, I will do my best to stop
the noises altogether,’ for the idea of forming
a little circle with these worthy people
had suddenly flashed into my mind.</p>

<p>‘How can me and my good man help
you, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Is Mr Bizzey at home? If so, go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
downstairs and fetch him up here, and I
will explain what I mean to you both at
the same time.’</p>

<p>She left the room at once, and in a few
minutes returned with a dapper-looking
little old fellow, in knee-breeches and a red
plush waistcoat, who pulled his forelock to
me on entering.</p>

<p>‘This is Mr Bizzey, sir, and I’ve been
telling him all you say as we came up the
stairs.’</p>

<p>I leant back in my chair, folded my
hands, and looked important.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you must have heard the
science of spiritualism mentioned?’ I commenced,
grandly.</p>

<p>‘The science of <i>what</i>, sir?’ inquired Mr
Bizzey, with a puzzled air.</p>

<p>‘Of spiritualism—<i>i.e.</i>, the power of converse
or communication with disembodied
spirits.’</p>

<p>‘Lor’! you never mean “<i>ghosts</i>,” sir?’
said the old woman.</p>

<p>‘I do, indeed, Mrs Bizzey. I suppose
you believe that spirits (or ghosts, as you
call them) may re-appear after death?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, yes,’ interposed the husband; ‘for
I mind the night that my poor mother lay
dying, there was an apparition of a turkey-cock
that sat upon the palings opposite our
cottage, and when it fluttered off ’em with
a screech, just for all the world like a real
turkey, you know, sir, she turned on her
side suddenly, and give up the ghost. I’ve
always believed in apparitions since then.’</p>

<p>‘And when my sister Jane lay in of her
last,’ chimed in Mrs Bizzey, ‘there was a
little clock stood on the mantel-shelf that
had always been wound up regular and
gone regular ever since she was married;
and we was moving a lot of things to one
side, and we moved that clock and found
it had stopped; and the nurse, she said to
me, “Mark my words if that’s not a warning
of death;” and, sure enough, Jane
died before the morning, which makes me
so careful of moving a clock since then
that I’d rather go three miles round than
touch one if a body lay sick in the house.’</p>

<p>‘I see that you both take a most sensible
view of the business, and are fully alive to
the importance attached to it,’ I answered;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
‘I hope, therefore, to secure your assistance
to find out what these unusual and
mysterious noises in your house portend,
and what the authors require us to do for
them.’</p>

<p>Then—whilst the old man scratched his
head with bewilderment, and the old woman
looked scared out of her seven senses—I
explained to them, as well as I was able,
the nature of a séance, and asked them if
they would come and sit at the table with
me that evening and hold one.</p>

<p>‘But, lawk a mussy, sir, you never want
to speak to them!’ cried Mrs Bizzey.</p>

<p>‘How else are we to ascertain for what
reason these spirits disturb your lodgers
and render your rooms uninhabitable by
their pranks?’</p>

<p>‘I should die of fright before we had
been at it five minutes,’ was her comment;
but her husband was pluckier, and took a
more practical view of the matter.</p>

<p>‘You’ll just do as I bid you, missus, and
hold your chatter. There’s no doubt these
noises are a great nuisance—not to say a
loss—and if this gentleman will be good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
enough to try and stop them, and can’t do
without us, I’ll help him for one, and you
will for another.’</p>

<p>Mrs Bizzey protested, and wept, and was
even refractory, but it was all of no avail,
and before we separated it had been agreed
we should meet again at ten o’clock, and
hold a séance. There was some whispering
between the old couple after that that
I did not quite understand, but as it ended
by Mrs Bizzey ejaculating, ‘Nonsense; I
tell you the house will be quiet enough by
ten o’clock,’ I concluded he was referring
to some expected visitor, and dismissed
the subject from my mind. As soon as
they had disappeared I delivered myself
up to self-gratulation. I was really going
to hold a séance, under my own direction
and the most favourable circumstances,
with a large haunted house at my command,
and no one to be any the wiser for
my dabbling in the necromantic art. I
took out an old number of the ‘Spiritualist,’
and referred to the directions for forming
circles at home. I prepared the
paper, pencils, and speaking tubes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
symmetrically arranged the table and
chairs.</p>

<p>Nothing was wanted when Mr and Mrs
Bizzey entered my room at the appointed
hour—he looking expectant, and she very
much alarmed. I was prepared for this,
however, and insisted upon their both
joining me in a glass of whisky and hot
water before commencing the sitting, alleging
as a reason the fact that the presence
of spirits invariably chills the atmosphere,
whether in summer or winter. So I mixed
three bumping tumblers of toddy, strong
enough to give us the courage we required
for the occasion; and after we had (according
to the directions) engaged for some
little time in light and friendly conversation,
I induced my friends to approach
the table.</p>

<p>It was now, I was glad to see by my
watch, about half-past eleven—just about
the time when the mysterious sounds had
commenced the night before; and having
lowered the lamp, much to Mrs Bizzey’s
horror, until it was represented by a mere
glimmer of light, I instructed her husband<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
and herself how to place their hands upon
the table, linked with mine, and the séance
began.</p>

<p>I had enjoined perfect silence on my
companions, and after we had been sitting
still for about fifteen minutes, during which
I had watched in vain for some symptoms
of movement on the part of the table, we
all heard distinctly the sound of a foot
creeping cautiously about the upper rooms,
upon which Mrs Bizzey, too frightened to
shriek, began to weep, and her husband,
in order to stop her, pinched her violently
in the dark.</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ I exclaimed, almost as agitated
as the woman. ‘Do not disturb them for
your life, and whatever you may see, don’t
scream.’</p>

<p>‘La, sir, you never mean to say that
they’ll come downstairs?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot say what they may do. I
think I hear a step descending now. But
remember, Mrs Bizzey, they will not hurt
you, and try and be brave for all our
sakes.’</p>

<p>We were in a state of high nervous excitement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
for the next five minutes, during
which the same noises I had heard the
night before were repeated overhead, only
that the curses were louder and delivered
with more determination, and the falls
appeared to succeed each other like hail.</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, what are they a-doing?’ exclaimed
Mrs Bizzey, paralysed with terror.
‘They must be killing each other all
round.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ I replied. ‘Listen, now. Some
one is pleading for love or for mercy. How
soft and clear the voice is!’</p>

<p>‘It sounds for all the world like my poor
sister Jane when she was asking her husband
to forgive her for everything she had
done amiss,’ said the old woman.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it is your sister Jane, or some
of your relations,’ I replied. ‘She may
want you to do something for her. Would
you be afraid if she were suddenly to open
the door and come into the room?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know, I’m sure, sir; but I
hope she mayn’t. It makes me curdle all
over only to think of it.’</p>

<p>‘They’re quieter now. Let us ask if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
there is any one present who wishes to
speak to us,’ I said; and addressing the
table to that effect, I commenced to spell
out the alphabet rather loudly—‘A, B, C,’
etc.</p>

<p>Whether from my nervousness, or the
united strain we laid upon it, I know not,
but the table certainly began to rock at
that juncture, though I could make neither
head nor tail of its intentions. Treating
it in the orthodox manner by which Britons
invariably attempt to communicate with a
foreigner who does not understand one
word of the language spoken, I began
to bawl at the table, and my A, B, C
must have reverberated through the empty
house.</p>

<p>Again the old woman whispered mysteriously
to the old man, but he dismissed her
question with an impatient answer; and
my attention was too much attracted in
another direction at that moment to give
much heed of what they were doing. My
ear had caught the sound of a descending
footstep, and I felt sure the spirits were at
last about to visit us <i>in propriæ personæ</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
But dreading the effect it might have on
Mrs Bizzey’s nerves, I purposely held my
tongue, and applied myself afresh to a
vigorous repetition of the alphabet, striving
to cover the approaching footstep by the
noise of my own voice, although I was
trembling with excitement and delight at
the successful issue of my undertaking.
At last I plainly heard the footstep pause
outside the door, as though deliberating
before it opened it. The old man was
apparently too deaf or too absorbed to
notice it, and his wife was in a state of
helpless fright. I alone sufficiently retained
my senses to see the door slowly
open, and a white-robed figure—a real,
materialised spirit—stand upon the threshold.
The gesture of delight, which I
could not repress, roused my companions
from their reverie; and as soon as Mrs
Bizzey turned and saw the figure, she
recognised it.</p>

<p>‘It’s Jane!’ she screamed. ‘It’s my
own poor sister Jane come back from the
grave to visit me again, with her red hair
and blue eyes; I can see ’em as plain as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
plain. I’ll die of the shock, I know I
shall!’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ I exclaimed, sternly, fearful,
lest by her folly she should scare the newly-born
spirit back to the spheres. ‘If it is
your sister, speak to her as you used to do.
Tell her you are glad to see her, and ask
if she wants anything done.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jane!’ said the old woman, half
falling upon her knees, ‘don’t come a-nigher
me, for mercy’s sake! I never kept
nothing of yourn back from the children
except the old blue dress, which it wouldn’t
have been no use for them to wear, and the
ring, which I had asked you to give me a
dozen times in your life, and you had
always refused. I’d give ’em both back
now if I could, Jane, but the gownd have
been on the dust-heap these twenty years
past, and the ring I sold the minute my
man was laid up with rheumatis. Forgive
me, Jane, forgive me!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Why, what on earth are you making
such a row about?</i>’ replied the spirit.</p>

<p>I leapt to my feet in a moment.</p>

<p>‘This is some shameful hoax!’ I exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
‘Who are you, and what do you
do here?’</p>

<p>‘I should think I might put the same
question to you, since I find you sitting in
the dark, at dead of night, with my landlord
and landlady.’</p>

<p>‘Lor’, Mr Montmorency, it’s never you,
sir!’ ejaculated old Bizzey, with a feeble
giggle.</p>

<p>The voice seemed familiar to me. Who
on earth was this Mr Montmorency, who
had intruded upon our séance at the most
important juncture? I turned up the lamp
and threw its light full upon his features.
‘Good heavens!’ I exclaimed, ‘it’s Julian
Cockleboat.’</p>

<p>The young man was equally astonished
with myself.</p>

<p>‘Did Lord Seaborne send you after me?’
he said, guessing the truth at once. ‘And
how did you find out I was lodging here?’</p>

<p>‘Aha, my boy!’ I replied, unwilling to
deny the <i>kúdos</i> with which he credited me,
‘that’s <i>my</i> secret. Do you suppose I have
gained the name of the amateur detective
among my friends for nothing? No, no!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
I am in Norwich expressly for the purpose
of restoring you to your guardian, and as I
knew that to show my hand more openly
would be to scare you off to another hiding
place, I devised this little plan for making
you reveal yourself in your true character.’</p>

<p>‘Did Robson tell you, then, that I had
taken an engagement at the theatre here?’</p>

<p>‘Never you mind, Mr Cockleboat; it is
quite sufficient that I knew it. This is a
proper sort of house to play hide-and-seek
in, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>I was dispersing the table and chairs
again with angry jerks as I spoke, fearful
lest my attempted investigation of the
occult mysteries should be discovered before
I had removed its traces.</p>

<p>‘Still I can’t understand how you discovered
that Mr Montmorency was myself,
although naturally my night rehearsals
must have disturbed you. But you told
me you had no other lodgers,’ continued
Julian Cockleboat reproachfully, to the
Bizzeys.</p>

<p>‘And you said the same thing to me,’ I
added, in similar tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>‘Well, sir—well, Mr Montmorency, I’m
very sorry it should have happened so,’
replied the landlord, turning from one to
the other, ‘but it’s all my old woman’s
fault, for I said to her—’</p>

<p>‘You did nothing of the sort,’ interrupted
his better half; ‘for when I come to you
and told you as a second gentleman wanted
rooms here, it was you as said, “Let him
have the little room upstairs, and no one
will be ever the wiser if he takes his meals
out of a day.”’</p>

<p>‘But we never thought—begging your
pardon, Mr Montmorency—as you’d take
such a liberty with the upper offices as to
make noises in them as should disturb the
whole house.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what was I to do?’ replied the
young man, appealing to me. ‘They’ve
given me three leading parts to get up at a
fortnight’s notice, and if I don’t study them
at night I have no chance of being ready
in time.’</p>

<p>‘In fact,’ I said, oracularly, ‘you’ve been
cheating each other all round. Mr Bizzey
has cheated his employers by letting apartments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
to which he has no right; you have
cheated the Bizzeys by using one which
you never hired of them; and I have—’
‘cheated myself,’ I might have added, but
I stopped short and looked wise instead.</p>

<p>‘And it was never no ghosts after all!’
said Mrs Bizzey, in accents of disappointment,
as her husband marched her downstairs.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is nothing more to tell. I reconciled
Mr Julian Cockleboat to his guardian
and his destiny; and I wrote ‘The Origin
of Dreams,’ the best part, by the way (as
all the critics affirmed), of ‘The Cyclopædia
of the Brain.’ I made more money by my
little trip than six months of ordinary labour
would have brought me; and Lord Seaborne
speaks of me to this day, amongst
his acquaintances, as the ‘very cleverest
amateur detective he has ever known.’</p>

<p>And so I am.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Mr Sigismund Braggett
was sitting in the little room he
called his study, wrapped in a
profound—not to say a mournful—reverie.
Now, there was nothing in
the present life nor surroundings of Mr
Braggett to account for such a demonstration.
He was a publisher and bookseller;
a man well to do, with a thriving business
in the city, and the prettiest of all pretty
villas at Streatham. And he was only just
turned forty; had not a grey hair in his
head nor a false tooth in his mouth; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
had been married but three short months
to one of the fairest and most affectionate
specimens of English womanhood that
ever transformed a bachelor’s quarters
into Paradise.</p>

<p>What more could Mr Sigismund Braggett
possibly want? Nothing! His
trouble lay in the fact that he had got
rather more than he wanted. Most of us
have our little peccadilloes in this world—awkward
reminiscences that we would like
to bury five fathoms deep, and never hear
mentioned again, but that have an uncomfortable
habit of cropping up at the most
inconvenient moments; and no mortal is
more likely to be troubled with them than
a middle-aged bachelor who has taken to
matrimony.</p>

<p>Mr Sigismund Braggett had no idea
what he was going in for when he led the
blushing Emily Primrose up to the altar,
and swore to be hers, and hers only, until
death should them part. He had no conception
a woman’s curiosity could be so
keen, her tongue so long, and her inventive
faculties so correct. He had spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
whole days before the fatal moment of
marriage in burning letters, erasing initials,
destroying locks of hair, and making offerings
of affection look as if he had purchased
them with his own money. But it had
been of little avail. Mrs Braggett had
swooped down upon him like a beautiful
bird of prey, and wheedled, coaxed, or
kissed him out of half his secrets before he
knew what he was about. But he had
never told her about Charlotte Cray. And
now he almost wished that he had done so,
for Charlotte Cray was the cause of his
present dejected mood.</p>

<p>Now, there are ladies <i>and</i> ladies in this
world. Some are very shy, and will only
permit themselves to be wooed by stealth.
Others, again, are the pursuers rather than
the pursued, and chase the wounded or the
flying even to the very doors of their
stronghold, or lie in wait for them like an
octopus, stretching out their tentacles on
every side in search of victims.</p>

<p>And to the latter class Miss Charlotte
Cray decidedly belonged. Not a person
worth mourning over, you will naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
say. But, then, Mr Sigismund Braggett
had not behaved well to her. She was
one of the ‘peccadilloes.’ She was an
authoress—not an author, mind you, which
term smacks more of the profession than the
sex—but an ‘authoress,’ with lots of the
‘ladylike’ about the plots of her stories and
the metre of her rhymes. They had come
together in the sweet connection of publisher
and writer—had met first in a dingy,
dusty little office at the back of his house
of business, and laid the foundation of
their friendship with the average amount
of chaffering and prevarication that usually
attend such proceedings.</p>

<p>Mr Braggett ran a risk in publishing
Miss Cray’s tales or verses, but he found
her useful in so many other ways that he
used occasionally to hold forth a sop to
Cerberus in the shape of publicity for the
sake of keeping her in his employ. For
Miss Charlotte Cray—who was as old
as himself, and had arrived at the period of
life when women are said to pray ‘Any,
good Lord, any!’—was really a clever
woman, and could turn her hand to most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
things required of her, or upon which she
had set her mind; and she had most decidedly
set her mind upon marrying Mr
Braggett, and he—to serve his own purposes—had
permitted her to cherish the
idea, and this was the Nemesis that was
weighing him down in the study at the
present moment. He had complimented
Miss Cray, and given her presents, and
taken her out a-pleasuring, all because she
was useful to him, and did odd jobs that
no one else would undertake, and for less
than any one else would have accepted;
and he had known the while that she was
in love with him, and that she believed he
was in love with her.</p>

<p>He had not thought much of it at the
time. He had not then made up his mind
to marry Emily Primrose, and considered
that what pleased Miss Cray, and harmed
no one else, was fair play for all sides.
But he had come to see things differently
now. He had been married three months,
and the first two weeks had been very
bitter ones to him. Miss Cray had written
him torrents of reproaches during that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
unhappy period, besides calling day after
day at his office to deliver them in person.
This and her threats had frightened him
out of his life. He had lived in hourly
terror lest the clerks should overhear what
passed at their interviews, or that his wife
should be made acquainted with them.</p>

<p>He had implored Miss Cray, both by
word of mouth and letter, to cease her
persecution of him; but all the reply he
received was that he was a base and perjured
man, and that she should continue to
call at his office, and write to him through
the penny post, until he had introduced
her to his wife. For therein lay the height
and depth of his offending. He had been
afraid to bring Emily and Miss Cray together,
and the latter resented the omission
as an insult. It was bad enough to find
that Sigismund Braggett, whose hair she
wore next her heart, and whose photograph
stood as in a shrine upon her bedroom
mantelpiece, had married another woman,
without giving her even the chance of a
refusal, but it was worse still to come to
the conclusion that he did not intend her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
to have a glimpse into the garden of Eden
he had created for himself.</p>

<p>Miss Cray was a lady of vivid imagination
and strong aspirations. All was not
lost in her ideas, although Mr Braggett
<i>had</i> proved false to the hopes he had
raised. Wives did not live for ever; and
the chances and changes of this life were
so numerous, that stranger things had
happened than that Mr Braggett might
think fit to make better use of the second
opportunity afforded him than he had done
of the first. But if she were not to continue
even his friend, it was too hard. But
the perjured publisher had continued resolute,
notwithstanding all Miss Cray’s persecution,
and now he had neither seen nor
heard from her for a month; and, man-like,
he was beginning to wonder what had
become of her, and whether she had found
anybody to console her for his untruth.
Mr Braggett did not wish to comfort Miss
Cray himself; but he did not quite like the
notion of her being comforted.</p>

<p>After all—so he soliloquised—he had
been very cruel to her; for the poor thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
was devoted to him. How her eyes used
to sparkle and her cheek to flush when she
entered his office, and how eagerly she
would undertake any work for him, however
disagreeable to perform! He knew
well that she had expected to be Mrs
Braggett, and it must have been a terrible
disappointment to her when he married
Emily Primrose.</p>

<p>Why had he not asked her out to Violet
Villa since? What harm could she do as
a visitor there? particularly if he cautioned
her first as to the peculiarity of Mrs Braggett’s
disposition, and the quickness with
which her jealousy was excited. It was
close upon Christmas-time, the period when
all old friends meet together and patch
up, if they cannot entirely forget, everything
that has annoyed them in the past.
Mr Braggett pictured to himself the poor
old maid sitting solitary in her small rooms
at Hammersmith, no longer able to live in
the expectation of seeing his manly form
at the wicket-gate, about to enter and
cheer her solitude. The thought smote
him as a two-edged sword, and he sat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
down at once and penned Miss Charlotte
a note, in which he inquired after her
health, and hoped that they should soon
see her at Violet Villa.</p>

<p>He felt much better after this note was
written and despatched. He came out of
the little study and entered the cheerful
drawing-room, and sat with his pretty wife
by the light of the fire, telling her of the
lonely lady to whom he had just proposed
to introduce her.</p>

<p>‘An old friend of mine, Emily. A
clever, agreeable woman, though rather
eccentric. You will be polite to her, I
know, for my sake.’</p>

<p>‘An <i>old</i> woman, is she?’ said Mrs
Braggett, elevating her eyebrows. ‘And
what do you call ‘old,’ Siggy, I should
like to know?’</p>

<p>‘Twice as old as yourself, my dear—five-and-forty
at the very least, and not
personable-looking, even for that age. Yet
I think you will find her a pleasant companion,
and I am sure she will be enchanted
with you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that: clever women don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
like me, as a rule, though I don’t know
why.’</p>

<p>‘They are jealous of your beauty, my
darling; but Miss Cray is above such
meanness, and will value you for your own
sake.’</p>

<p>‘She’d better not let me catch her
valuing me for <i>yours</i>,’ responded Mrs
Braggett, with a flash of the eye that made
her husband ready to regret the dangerous
experiment he was about to make of
bringing together two women who had
each, in her own way, a claim upon him,
and each the will to maintain it.</p>

<p>So he dropped the subject of Miss
Charlotte Cray, and took to admiring his
wife’s complexion instead, so that the
evening passed harmoniously, and both
parties were satisfied.</p>

<p>For two days Mr Braggett received no
answer from Miss Cray, which rather
surprised him. He had quite expected
that on the reception of his invitation she
would rush down to his office and into his
arms, behind the shelter of the ground-glass
door that enclosed his chair of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
authority. For Miss Charlotte had been
used on occasions to indulge in rapturous
demonstrations of the sort, and the remembrance
of Mrs Braggett located in Violet
Villa would have been no obstacle whatever
to her. She believed she had a prior
claim to Mr Braggett. However, nothing
of the kind happened, and the perjured
publisher was becoming strongly imbued
with the idea that he must go out to Hammersmith
and see if he could not make his
peace with her in person, particularly as he
had several odd jobs for Christmas-tide,
which no one could undertake so well as
herself, when a letter with a black-edged
border was put into his hand. He opened
it mechanically, not knowing the writing;
but its contents shocked him beyond
measure.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,—I am sorry to tell
you that Miss Cray died at my house a
week ago, and was buried yesterday. She
spoke of you several times during her last
illness, and if you would like to hear any
further particulars, and will call on me at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
the old address, I shall be most happy to
furnish you with them.—Yours respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">Mary Thompson</span>.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>When Mr Braggett read this news, you
might have knocked him over with a feather.
It is not always true that a living dog is
better than a dead lion. Some people gain
considerably in the estimation of their
friends by leaving this world, and Miss
Charlotte Cray was one of them. Her
persecution had ceased for ever, and her
amiable weaknesses were alone held in remembrance.
Mr Braggett felt a positive
relief in the knowledge that his dead friend
and his wife would never now be brought
in contact with each other; but at the
same time he blamed himself more than
was needful, perhaps, for not having seen
nor communicated with Miss Cray for so
long before her death. He came down to
breakfast with a portentously grave face
that morning, and imparted the sad intelligence
to Mrs Braggett with the air of an
undertaker. Emily wondered, pitied, and
sympathised, but the dead lady was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
more to her than any other stranger; and
she was surprised her husband looked so
solemn over it all. Mr Braggett, however,
could not dismiss the subject easily from
his mind. It haunted him during the business
hours of the morning, and as soon as
he could conveniently leave his office, he
posted away to Hammersmith. The little
house in which Miss Cray used to live
looked just the same, both inside and outside:
how strange it seemed that <i>she</i> should
have flown away from it for ever! And
here was her landlady, Mrs Thompson,
bobbing and curtseying to him in the same
old black net cap with artificial flowers in
it, and the same stuff gown she had worn
since he first saw her, with her apron in
her hand, it is true, ready to go to her
eyes as soon as a reasonable opportunity
occurred, but otherwise the same Mrs
Thompson as before. And yet she would
never wait upon <i>her</i> again.</p>

<p>‘It was all so sudden, sir,’ she said, in
answer to Mr Braggett’s inquiries, ‘that
there was no time to send for nobody.’</p>

<p>‘But Miss Cray had my address.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah! perhaps so; but she was off her
head, poor dear, and couldn’t think of
nothing. But she remembered you, sir, to
the last; for the very morning she died,
she sprung up in bed and called out, ‘Sigismund!
Sigismund!’ as loud as ever she
could, and she never spoke to anybody
afterwards, not one word.’</p>

<p>‘She left no message for me?’</p>

<p>‘None, sir. I asked her the day before
she went if I was to say nothing to you for
her (knowing you was such friends), and
all her answer was, “I wrote to him. He’s
got my letter.” So I thought, perhaps,
you had heard, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Not for some time past. It seems
terribly sudden to me, not having
heard even of her illness. Where is
she buried?’</p>

<p>‘Close by in the churchyard, sir. My
little girl will go with you and show you
the place, if you’d like to see it.’</p>

<p>Mr Braggett accepted her offer and left.</p>

<p>When he was standing by a heap of
clods they called a grave, and had dismissed
the child, he drew out Miss Cray’s last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
letter, which he carried in his pocket, and
read it over.</p>

<p>‘You tell me that I am not to call at
your office again, except on business’ (so
it ran), ‘nor to send letters to your private
address, lest it should come to the knowledge
of your wife, and create unpleasantness
between you; but I <i>shall</i> call, and I
<i>shall</i> write, until I have seen Mrs Braggett,
and, if you don’t take care, I will introduce
myself to her and tell her the reason you
have been afraid to do so.’</p>

<p>This letter had made Mr Braggett terribly
angry at the time of reception. He
had puffed and fumed, and cursed Miss
Charlotte by all his gods for daring to
threaten him. But he read it with different
feelings now Miss Charlotte was down
there, six feet beneath the ground he stood
on, and he could feel only compassion for
her frenzy, and resentment against himself
for having excited it. As he travelled
home from Hammersmith to Streatham, he
was a very dejected publisher indeed.</p>

<p>He did not tell Mrs Braggett the reason
of his melancholy, but it affected him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
that degree that he could not go to office
on the following day, but stayed at home
instead, to be petted and waited upon by
his pretty wife, which treatment resulted
in a complete cure. The next morning,
therefore, he started for London as briskly
as ever, and arrived at office before his
usual time. A clerk, deputed to receive
all messages for his master, followed him
behind the ground-glass doors, with a packet
of letters.</p>

<p>‘Mr Van Ower was here yesterday, sir.
He will let you have the copy before the
end of the week, and Messrs Hanleys’
foreman called on particular business, and
will look in to-day at eleven. And Mr
Ellis came to ask if there was any answer
to his letter yet; and Miss Cray called,
sir; and that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Who</i> did you say?’ cried Braggett.</p>

<p>‘Miss Cray, sir. She waited for you
above an hour, but I told her I thought
you couldn’t mean to come into town at
all, so she went.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know what you’re talking about,
Hewetson? You said <i>Miss Cray</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>‘And I meant it, sir—Miss Charlotte
Cray. Burns spoke to her as well as I.’</p>

<p>‘Good heavens!’ exclaimed Mr Braggett,
turning as white as a sheet. ‘Go at
once and send Burns to me.’ Burns came.</p>

<p>‘Burns, who was the lady that called to
see me yesterday?’</p>

<p>‘Miss Cray, sir. She had a very thick
veil on, and she looked so pale that I asked
her if she had been ill, and she said “Yes.”
She sat in the office for over an hour,
hoping you’d come in, but as you didn’t,
she went away again.’</p>

<p>‘Did she lift her veil?’</p>

<p>‘Not whilst I spoke to her, sir.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know it was Miss Cray,
then?’</p>

<p>The clerk stared. ‘Well, sir, we all
know her pretty well by this time.’</p>

<p>‘Did you ask her name?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir; there was no need to do it.’</p>

<p>‘You’re mistaken, that’s all, both you
and Hewetson. It couldn’t have been
Miss Cray! I know for certain that she
is—is—is—not in London at present. It
must have been a stranger.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>‘It was not, indeed, sir, begging your
pardon. I could tell Miss Cray anywhere,
by her figure and her voice, without seeing
her face. But I <i>did</i> see her face, and remarked
how awfully pale she was—just
like death, sir!’</p>

<p>‘There! there! that will do! It’s of
no consequence, and you can go back to
your work.’</p>

<p>But any one who had seen Mr Braggett,
when left alone in his office, would not
have said he thought the matter of no
consequence. The perspiration broke out
upon his forehead, although it was December,
and he rocked himself backward and
forward in his chair with agitation.</p>

<p>At last he rose hurriedly, upset his throne,
and dashed through the outer premises in
the face of twenty people waiting to speak
to him. As soon as he could find his voice,
he hailed a hansom, and drove to Hammersmith.
Good Mrs Thompson opening the
door to him, thought he looked as if he had
just come out of a fever.</p>

<p>‘Lor’ bless me, sir! whatever’s the
matter?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>‘Mrs Thompson, have you told me the
truth about Miss Cray? Is she really
dead?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Really dead</i>, sir! Why, I closed her
eyes, and put her in the coffin with my own
hands! If she ain’t dead, I don’t know
who is! But if you doubt my word, you’d
better ask the doctor that gave the certificate
for her.’</p>

<p>‘What is the doctor’s name?’</p>

<p>‘Dodson; he lives opposite.’</p>

<p>‘You must forgive my strange questions,
Mrs Thompson, but I have had a terrible
dream about my poor friend, and I think
I should like to talk to the doctor about
her.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very good, sir,’ cried the landlady,
much offended. ‘I’m not afraid of what
the doctor will tell you. She had excellent
nursing and everything as she could desire,
and there’s nothing on my conscience
on that score, so I’ll wish you good morning.’
And with that Mrs Thompson
slammed the door in Mr Braggett’s face.</p>

<p>He found Dr Dodson at home.</p>

<p>‘If I understand you rightly,’ said the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
practitioner, looking rather steadfastly in
the scared face of his visitor, ‘you wish,
as a friend of the late Miss Cray’s, to see
a copy of the certificate of her death?
Very good, sir; here it is. She died, as
you will perceive, on the twenty-fifth of
November, of peritonitis. She had, I can
assure you, every attention and care, but
nothing could have saved her.’</p>

<p>‘You are quite sure, then, she is dead?’
demanded Mr Braggett, in a vague manner.</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him as if he were
not quite sure if he were sane.</p>

<p>‘If seeing a patient die, and her corpse
coffined and buried, is being sure she is
dead, <i>I</i> am in no doubt whatever about
Miss Cray.’</p>

<p>‘It is very strange—most strange and
unaccountable,’ murmured poor Mr Braggett,
in reply, as he shuffled out of the
doctor’s passage, and took his way back
to the office.</p>

<p>Here, however, after an interval of rest
and a strong brandy and soda, he managed
to pull himself together, and to come to
the conclusion that the doctor and Mrs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
Thompson <i>could</i> not be mistaken, and
that, consequently, the clerks <i>must</i>. He
did not mention the subject again to them,
however; and as the days went on, and
nothing more was heard of the mysterious
stranger’s visit, Mr Braggett put it altogether
out of his mind.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight, however,
when he was thinking of something totally
different, young Hewetson remarked to
him, carelessly,—</p>

<p>‘Miss Cray was here again yesterday,
sir. She walked in just as your cab had
left the door.’</p>

<p>All the horror of his first suspicions returned
with double force upon the unhappy
man’s mind.</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk nonsense!’ he gasped,
angrily, as soon as he could speak. ‘Don’t
attempt to play any of your tricks on me,
young man, or it will be the worse for you,
I can tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Tricks, sir!’ stammered the clerk. ‘I
don’t know what you are alluding to. I
am only telling you the truth. You have
always desired me to be most particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
in letting you know the names of the
people who call in your absence, and I
thought I was only doing my duty in
making a point of ascertaining them—’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes! Hewetson, of course,’ replied
Mr Braggett, passing his handkerchief
over his brow, ‘and you are quite
right in following my directions as closely
as possible; only—in this case you are
completely mistaken, and it is the second
time you have committed the error.’</p>

<p>‘Mistaken!’</p>

<p>‘Yes!—as mistaken as it is possible for
a man to be! Miss Cray <i>could</i> not have
called at this office yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘But she did, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Am I labouring under some horrible
nightmare?’ exclaimed the publisher, ‘or
are we playing at cross purposes? Can
you mean the Miss Cray I mean?’</p>

<p>‘I am speaking of Miss Charlotte Cray,
sir, the author of “Sweet Gwendoline,”—the
lady who has undertaken so much of
our compilation the last two years, and
who has a long nose, and wears her hair
in curls. I never knew there was another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Miss Cray; but if there are two, that is
the one I mean.’</p>

<p>‘Still I <i>cannot</i> believe it, Hewetson, for
the Miss Cray who has been associated
with our firm died on the twenty-fifth of
last month.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Died</i>, sir! Is Miss Cray dead? Oh,
it can’t be! It’s some humbugging trick
that’s been played upon you, for I’d swear
she was in this room yesterday afternoon,
as full of life as she’s ever been since I
knew her. She didn’t talk much, it’s true,
for she seemed in a hurry to be off again,
but she had got on the same dress and
bonnet she was in here last, and she made
herself as much at home in the office as
she ever did. Besides,’ continued Hewetson,
as though suddenly remembering
something, ‘she left a note for you, sir.’</p>

<p>‘A note! Why did you not say so
before?’</p>

<p>‘It slipped my memory when you began
to doubt my word in that way, sir. But
you’ll find it in the bronze vase. She told
me to tell you she had placed it there.’</p>

<p>Mr Braggett made a dash at the vase,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
and found the three-cornered note as he
had been told. Yes! it was Charlotte’s
handwriting, or the facsimile of it, there
was no doubt of that; and his hands shook
so he could hardly open the paper. It
contained these words:</p>

<p>‘You tell me that I am not to call at
your office again, except on business, nor
to send letters to your private address, lest
it should come to the knowledge of your
wife, and create unpleasantness between
you; but I <i>shall</i> call, and I <i>shall</i> write until
I have seen Mrs Braggett, and if you don’t
take care I will introduce myself to her,
and tell her the reason you have been
afraid to do so.’</p>

<p>Precisely the same words, in the same
writing of the letter he still carried in his
breast-pocket, and which no mortal eyes
but his and hers had ever seen. As the
unhappy man sat gazing at the opened
note, his whole body shook as if he were
attacked by ague.</p>

<p>‘It is Miss Cray’s handwriting, isn’t it,
sir?’</p>

<p>‘It looks like it, Hewetson, but it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
be. I tell you it is an impossibility!
Miss Cray died last month, and I have
seen not only her grave, but the doctor
and nurse who attended her in her last
illness. It is folly, then, to suppose either
that she called here or wrote that letter.’</p>

<p>‘Then <i>who could it have been</i>, sir?’ said
Hewetson, attacked with a sudden terror
in his turn.</p>

<p>‘That is impossible for me to say; but
should the lady call again, you had better
ask her boldly for her name and address.’</p>

<p>‘I’d rather you’d depute the office to
anybody but me, sir,’ replied the clerk, as
he hastily backed out of the room.</p>

<p>Mr Braggett, dying with suspense and
conjecture, went through his business as
best he could, and hurried home to Violet
Villa.</p>

<p>There he found that his wife had been
spending the day with a friend, and only
entered the house a few minutes before
himself.</p>

<p>‘Siggy, dear!’ she commenced, as soon
as he joined her in the drawing-room after
dinner; ‘I really think we should have the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
fastenings and bolts of this house looked
to. Such a funny thing happened whilst
I was out this afternoon. Ellen has just
been telling me about it.’</p>

<p>‘What sort of a thing, dear?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I left home as early as twelve,
you know, and told the servants I shouldn’t
be back until dinner-time; so they were
all enjoying themselves in the kitchen, I
suppose, when cook told Ellen she heard
a footstep in the drawing-room. Ellen
thought at first it must be cook’s fancy,
because she was sure the front door was
fastened; but when they listened, they all
heard the noise together, so she ran upstairs,
and what on earth do you think
she saw?’</p>

<p>‘How can I guess, my dear?’</p>

<p>‘Why, a lady, seated in this very room,
as if she was waiting for somebody. She
was oldish, Ellen says, and had a very
white face, with long curls hanging down
each side of it; and she wore a blue
bonnet with white feathers, and a long
black cloak, and—’</p>

<p>‘Emily, Emily! Stop! You don’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
know what you’re talking about. That
girl is a fool: you must send her away.
That is, how could the lady have got in
if the door was closed? Good heavens!
you’ll all drive me mad between you with
your folly!’ exclaimed Mr Braggett, as he
threw himself back in his chair, with an
exclamation that sounded very like a groan.</p>

<p>Pretty Mrs Braggett was offended. What
had she said or done that her husband
should doubt her word? She tossed her
head in indignation, and remained silent.
If Mr Braggett wanted any further information,
he would have to apologise.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, darling,’ he said, after a
long pause. ‘I don’t think I’m very well
this evening, but your story seemed to
upset me.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see why it should upset you,’
returned Mrs Braggett. ‘If strangers are
allowed to come prowling about the house
in this way, we shall be robbed some day,
and then you’ll say I should have told
you of it.’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t she—this person—give her
name?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh! I’d rather say no more about it.
You had better ask Ellen.’</p>

<p>‘No, Emily! I’d rather hear it from you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, don’t interrupt me again, then.
When Ellen saw the woman seated here,
she asked her her name and business at
once, but she gave no answer, and only
sat and stared at her. And so Ellen,
feeling very uncomfortable, had just turned
round to call up cook, when the woman got
up, and dashed past her like a flash of
lightning, and they saw nothing more of
her!’</p>

<p>‘Which way did she leave the house?’</p>

<p>‘Nobody knows any more than how
she came in. The servants declare the
hall-door was neither opened nor shut—but,
of course, it must have been. She
was a tall gaunt woman, Ellen says, about
fifty, and she’s sure her hair was dyed.
She must have come to steal something,
and that’s why I say we ought to have
the house made more secure. Why,
Siggy! Siggy! what’s the matter? Here,
Ellen! Jane! come, quick, some of you!
Your master’s fainted!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>And, sure enough, the repeated shocks
and horrors of the day had had such an
effect upon poor Mr Braggett, that for a
moment he did lose all consciousness of
what surrounded him. He was thankful
to take advantage of the Christmas holidays,
to run over to Paris with his wife, and try
to forget, in the many marvels of that city,
the awful fear that fastened upon him at
the mention of anything connected with
home. He might be enjoying himself
to the top of his bent; but directly the
remembrance of Charlotte Cray crossed his
mind, all sense of enjoyment vanished, and
he trembled at the mere thought of returning
to his business, as a child does when
sent to bed in the dark.</p>

<p>He tried to hide the state of his feelings
from Mrs Braggett, but she was too sharp
for him. The simple, blushing Emily
Primrose had developed, under the influence
of the matrimonial forcing-frame, into
a good watch-dog, and nothing escaped her
notice.</p>

<p>Left to her own conjecture, she attributed
his frequent moods of dejection to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
the existence of some other woman, and
became jealous accordingly. If Siggy did
not love her, why had he married her?
She felt certain there was some other
horrid creature who had engaged his affections
and would not leave him alone, even
now that he was her own lawful property.
And to find out who the ‘horrid creature’
was became Mrs Emily’s constant idea.
When she had found out, she meant to
give her a piece of her mind, never fear!
Meanwhile Mr Braggett’s evident distaste
to returning to business only served to
increase his wife’s suspicions. A clear
conscience, she argued, would know no
fear. So they were not a happy couple,
as they set their faces once more towards
England. Mr Braggett’s dread of re-entering
his office amounted almost to
terror, and Mrs Braggett, putting this and
that together, resolved that she would
fathom the mystery, if it lay in feminine
<i>finesse</i> to do so. She did not whisper a
word of her intentions to dear Siggy, you
may be sure of that! She worked after
the manner of her amiable sex, like a cat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
in the dark, or a worm boring through the
earth, and appearing on the surface when
least expected.</p>

<p>So poor Mr Braggett brought her home
again, heavy at heart indeed, but quite
ignorant that any designs were being made
against him. I think he would have given
a thousand pounds to be spared the duty
of attending office the day after his arrival.
But it was necessary, and he went, like a
publisher and a Briton. But Mrs Emily
had noted his trepidation and his fears, and
laid her plans accordingly. She had never
been asked to enter those mysterious
precincts, the house of business. Mr
Braggett had not thought it necessary
that her blooming loveliness should be
made acquainted with its dingy, dusty
accessories, but she meant to see them
for herself to-day. So she waited till he
had left Violet Villa ten minutes, and then
she dressed and followed him by the next
train to London.</p>

<p>Mr Sigismund Braggett meanwhile had
gone on his way, as people go to a dentist,
determined to do what was right, but with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
an indefinite sort of idea that he might
never come out of it alive. He dreaded to
hear what might have happened in his
absence, and he delayed his arrival at the
office for half-an-hour, by walking there
instead of taking a cab as usual, in order
to put off the evil moment. As he entered
the place, however, he saw at a glance that
his efforts were vain, and that something
had occurred. The customary formality
and precision of the office were upset, and
the clerks, instead of bending over their
ledgers, or attending to the demands of
business, were all huddled together at one
end whispering and gesticulating to each
other. But as soon as the publisher
appeared, a dead silence fell upon the
group, and they only stared at him with
an air of horrid mystery.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter now?’ he demanded,
angrily, for like most men when
in a fright which they are ashamed to
exhibit, Mr Sigismund Braggett tried to
cover his want of courage by bounce.</p>

<p>The young man called Hewetson advanced
towards him, with a face the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
colour of ashes, and pointed towards
the ground-glass doors dumbly.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean? Can’t you speak?
What’s come to the lot of you, that you
are neglecting my business in this fashion
to make fools of yourselves?’</p>

<p>‘If you please, sir, she’s in there.’</p>

<p>Mr Braggett started back as if he’d
been shot. But still he tried to have it
out.</p>

<p>‘<i>She!</i> Who’s <i>she</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Miss Cray, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t I told you already that’s a lie.’</p>

<p>‘Will you judge for yourself, Mr Braggett?’
said a grey-haired man, stepping
forward. ‘I was on the stairs myself just
now when Miss Cray passed me, and
I have no doubt whatever but that you
will find her in your private room, however
much the reports that have lately
reached you may seem against the probability
of such a thing.’</p>

<p>Mr Braggett’s teeth chattered in his
head as he advanced to the ground-glass
doors, through the panes of one of which
there was a little peephole to ascertain if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the room were occupied or not. He
stooped and looked in. At the table, with
her back towards him, was seated the well-known
figure of Charlotte Cray. He
recognised at once the long black mantle
in which she was wont to drape her gaunt
figure—the blue bonnet, with its dejected-looking,
uncurled feather—the lank curls
which rested on her shoulders—and the
black-leather bag, with a steel clasp, which
she always carried in her hand. It was
the embodiment of Charlotte Cray, he had
no doubt of that; but how could he reconcile
the fact of her being there with the
damp clods he had seen piled upon her
grave, with the certificate of death, and
the doctor’s and landlady’s assertion that
they had watched her last moments?</p>

<p>At last he prepared, with desperate
energy, to turn the handle of the door.
At that moment the attention of the more
frivolous of the clerks was directed from
his actions by the entrance of an uncommonly
pretty woman at the other end of
the outer office. Such a lovely creature
as this seldom brightened the gloom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
their dusty abiding-place. Lilies, roses,
and carnations vied with each other in her
complexion, whilst the sunniest of locks,
and the brightest of blue eyes, lent her
face a girlish charm not easily described.
What could this fashionably-attired Venus
want in their house of business?</p>

<p>‘Is Mr Braggett here? I am Mrs
Braggett. Please show me in to him immediately.’</p>

<p>They glanced at the ground-glass doors
of the inner office. They had already closed
behind the manly form of their employer.</p>

<p>‘This way, madam,’ one said, deferentially,
as he escorted her to the presence
of Mr Braggett.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sigismund had opened the
portals of the Temple of Mystery, and
with trembling knees entered it. The
figure in the chair did not stir at his
approach. He stood at the door irresolute.
What should he do or say?</p>

<p>‘Charlotte,’ he whispered.</p>

<p>Still she did not move.</p>

<p>At that moment his wife entered.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sigismund!’ cried Mrs Emily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
reproachfully, ‘I knew you were keeping
something from me, and now I’ve caught
you in the very act. Who is this lady,
and what is her name? I shall refuse to
leave the room until I know it.’</p>

<p>At the sound of her rival’s voice, the
woman in the chair rose quickly to her
feet and confronted them. Yes! there
was Charlotte Cray, precisely similar to
what she had appeared in life, only with
an uncertainty and vagueness about the
lines of the familiar features that made
them ghastly.</p>

<p>She stood there, looking Mrs Emily
full in the face, but only for a moment,
for, even as she gazed, the lineaments
grew less and less distinct, with the shape
of the figure that supported them, until,
with a crash, the apparition seemed to fall
in and disappear, and the place that had
known her was filled with empty air.</p>

<p>‘Where is she gone?’ exclaimed Mrs
Braggett, in a tone of utter amazement.</p>

<p>‘Where is <i>who</i> gone?’ repeated Mr
Braggett, hardly able to articulate from
fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>‘The lady in the chair!’</p>

<p>‘There was no one there except in your
own imagination. It was my great-coat
that you mistook for a figure,’ returned her
husband hastily, as he threw the article in
question over the back of the arm-chair.</p>

<p>‘But how could that have been?’ said
his pretty wife, rubbing her eyes. ‘How
could I think a coat had eyes, and hair,
and features? I am <i>sure</i> I saw a woman
seated there, and that she rose and stared
at me. Siggy! tell me it was true. It
seems so incomprehensible that I should
have been mistaken.’</p>

<p>‘You must question your own sense.
You see that the room is empty now,
except for ourselves, and you know that
no one has left it. If you like to search
under the table, you can.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! now, Siggy, you are laughing at
me, because you know that would be folly.
But there was certainly some one here—only,
where can she have disappeared to?’</p>

<p>‘Suppose we discuss the matter at a
more convenient season,’ replied Mr Braggett,
as he drew his wife’s arm through his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
arm. ‘Hewetson! you will be able to tell
Mr Hume that he was mistaken. Say,
also, that I shall not be back in the office
to-day. I am not so strong as I thought
I was, and feel quite unequal to business.
Tell him to come out to Streatham this
evening with my letters, and I will talk
with him there.’</p>

<p>What passed at that interview was never
disclosed; but pretty Mrs Braggett was
much rejoiced, a short time afterwards, by
her husband telling her that he had resolved
to resign his active share of the
business, and devote the rest of his life to
her and Violet Villa. He would have no
more occasion, therefore, to visit the office,
and be exposed to the temptation of spending
four or five hours out of every twelve
away from her side. For, though Mrs
Emily had arrived at the conclusion that
the momentary glimpse she caught of a
lady in Siggy’s office must have been a
delusion, she was not quite satisfied by his
assertions that she would never have found
a more tangible cause for her jealousy.</p>

<p>But Sigismund Braggett knew more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
than he chose to tell Mrs Emily. He
knew that what she had witnessed was
no delusion, but a reality; and that Charlotte
Cray had carried out her dying
determination to call at his office and his
private residence, <i>until she had seen his
wife</i>!</p>
